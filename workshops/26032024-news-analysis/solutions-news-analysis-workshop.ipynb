The richest ten percent of residents actually started emitting more CO2 in the same period. Oxfam warns that the richest group of EU citizens must reduce their consumption by 90 percent by 2030 to keep global warming limited to one and a half degrees. This is generally regarded as a sustainable increase in global temperature. Oxfam comes to the conclusions by looking at public data on CO2 emissions in EU countries between 1990 and 2015 and the income distribution in those countries. During that period, CO2 emissions in the EU fell by 12 percent, but this appears to be mainly due to the poorest half of EU citizens, with an annual income of up to 20,000 euros. They reduced their CO2 emissions by 24 percent. Europeans with an income of up to 41,000 euros per year produced 13 percent fewer emissions in the same period. Europeans with an annual income of more than 41,000 euros (roughly ten percent of the population) started emitting three percent more CO2, mainly due to increased air and road traffic, reports the non-governmental organization that fights poverty and inequality. The richest ten percent of EU citizens now emit as much CO2 as the poorest half, the report shows. There is also a big difference between EU countries, says Oxfam. The richest ten percent of Spaniards, Germans, Italians and French, together about 26 million people, emit as much CO2 as the total population of 16 other EU member states, together about 85 million people. \\u201cThe reduction in CO2 emissions has so far been paid for by poorer Europeans,\\u201d says Oxfam researcher Tim Gore, \\u201cwhile the richer have not done their part. Now everyone must contribute to a stronger reduction in the coming years. The protests of the Yellow Vests in France show how quickly climate measures can lead to problems if they are not based on a fair distribution of the burden.\\\"\",\n          \"Early next year, Amsterdam residents with a low income can get a laptop for a 20 euro 'deposit'. Organizations and private individuals can donate laptops for this purpose. This is possible from tomorrow, at the Cyberbank, an organization with which the municipality collaborates. The computers are refurbished by young people who are at a distance from the labor market, NH Nieuws reports. Councilor Meliani hopes that many laptops will be donated. \\\"Our city is digitizing at a rapid pace, a development that has been accelerated by corona. This also increases the gap between Amsterdammers who can use the internet and all digital options, and Amsterdammers who cannot.\\\" The municipality also has another initiative where people can receive a laptop. \\\"But that was set up because of the corona situation. A kind of emergency solution because we saw that many people did not come,\\\" says a spokesperson for the municipality. Nearly 4,000 Amsterdam residents have now received a laptop from that project. In principle, that initiative will expire this year. \\\"Cyberbank's initiative aims to create a permanent place where laptops are given to people every month.\\\" The Cyberbank also helps people with questions about computers. The computers are issued at a \\\"kind of food bank for laptops\\\" in East Amsterdam. Amsterdam residents can pick them up early next year. Anyone who wants a laptop must have a city pass. Users who no longer need the computers can return them. They will then get their 20 euros back.\",\n          \"It could hardly have escaped your attention last week: the major biennial AIDS conference took place in Amsterdam this year. The PR machines were running at full speed. One celebrity after another appeared around the conference to say that 'we are far from there yet'. Bill Clinton closed the conference this afternoon. He was prevented from speaking after just a few seconds by a group of loudly protesting sex workers. They demand recognition of their profession and they also do not want the next AIDS conference to be held in San Francisco, as is currently planned. In his speech, Clinton praises the Dutch commitment to the fight against AIDS. He also reminds the audience of the Dutch AIDS experts Joep Lange and Jacqueline van Tongeren, who died on flight MH17 while on their way to the AIDS conference in Australia in 2014. Clinton emphasized that many people still die from AIDS-related diseases: Previously this week, Charlize Theron praised 'Dutch openness and acceptance'. Elton John, with Prince Harry next to him on stage, talked about how much Harry's openness resembles that of his mother, Princess Diana. And that his 'passionate and dedicated' character is necessary for the fight against HIV/AIDS. No medical breakthrough was announced during the conference, nor was that expected. There was a lot of knowledge exchange and many hands were shaken. \\u201cThis conference naturally creates a momentum to put the subject back on the agenda, as it were,\\u201d says Arco Timmermans. He holds a specially appointed lobby chair at Leiden University. \\\"The conference itself is of course part of an extensive lobbying strategy.\\\" Timmermans sees similarities with the Climate Conference in Paris 2015. \\\"Such a conference is a large combination of all kinds of organizations and well-known people to show ministries and policymakers worldwide: we must all put our shoulders to the wheel, otherwise we will It's out of control.\\\" Elton John announced the launch of a new fund last week, but emphasized during the conference that it is not about the well-known figureheads. \\\"I don't make the decisions. Politicians must stand up and put an end to this disease. Please, think like human beings.\\\" A direct plea to the people in charge of the money. The HIV/AIDS lobby benefits from a somewhat dramatic tone, says Timmermans. \\\"And I don't mean that it is attention-grabbing, but the message needs a new impetus. The problem for the disease is that many people in the Western world think: aren't there good medicines for that?\\\" This can lead to a decreased sense of urgency. A major conference can rekindle that feeling. \\\"The lobby wants policy change, away from the idea that everything is pretty much under control.\\\" AIDS lobbyist Peter van Rooijen has been working on putting and keeping the topic of HIV/AIDS on the agenda for almost forty years. \\\"Call it lobbying, or call it bringing an important issue into the spotlight in good consultation,\\\" he says. He is currently director of a major international AIDS lobby organization. He came out of the closet himself in the early 1980s. \\\"I wanted to do something for my friends. We were afraid this epidemic would sweep the world.\\\" And so he went to The Hague with the message that doing 'something' could no longer wait. Invested in intensive contacts with MPs and contacted the ministry. In 1987, the urgency of the message seemed to have reached politics. A National Committee to Combat AIDS was established. \\\"It was the first time that a committee was set up for a disease. The epidemic created political momentum and the insight that attention and money were needed.\\\" Ironically, in getting the message across today, the lobby seems to be 'bothered' by the medical progress made. \\u201cThe framing of the subject has changed,\\u201d says Timmermans. Things are improving not only in the West, but also in African countries. Van Rooijen notices this in the cash flows. \\\"If poverty decreases, donors will withdraw. The danger is that prevention will then fall through the cracks.\\\" \\\"If you hold attention with your message for six years, you are a great person,\\\" says Van Rooijen. Prevention is one of the themes discussed at the conference. \\\"A message for change, away from the idea that it is well under control, needs a lot of momentum, a lot of energy to land in the administrative world,\\\" says Timmermans. \\u201cCreating momentum is what this is partly about.\\u201d Elton John, Princess Mabel, Charlize Theron, politicians and scientists; Now that the conference is over, everyone goes their own way. \\\"As a campaign, the conference was a success,\\\" thinks Timmermans. \\u201cBut it is not the case that successful visible campaigns always ultimately have the most effect in the long term,\\u201d he continues. \\\"The question is whether the conference will also reach the more invisible rooms of funders. No one will be against the fight against HIV, but the competition for money, with other themes that play a role in a world in which care is becoming increasingly expensive, is now once grown up.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 3,\n        \"min\": 2010,\n        \"max\": 2023,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 14,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2019,\n          2021,\n          2010\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Almost one in three children does not know the PIN code by heart and parents are no longer so sure whether their child uses PIN safely. This is evident from the Nibud Children's Survey 2018. The institute, which provides information about financial matters, finds this worrying. The number of children aged ten and over who use their own pins has risen from 17 to 31 percent in five years. The percentage of children who know the PIN code by heart has actually fallen by 16 percent, from 78 to 62 percent. Fewer parents than before are sure that their children are using their PIN safely and that no one is watching. Five years ago, 90 percent thought they knew this for sure, now that has dropped to 72 percent. Three-quarters of children aged 10 and older now have their own bank account; half of them do not have a debit card. 37 percent of this age group has an activated debit card and more than half sometimes use a debit card themselves, usually when their parents are present. Many parents think children are still too young to allow them to use their own debit card. Almost half of the parents of children with a bank account monitor the credits and debits, especially for children under the age of ten. For children over ten years old, less than a third of parents still do this. Three-quarters of parents do not think that it is easier for their child to spend money with a bank card, but parents with a low income do think so. According to Nibud, children from the age of ten must learn to use a debit card. Parents must explain to the children how it works, demonstrate it and watch with the children. From secondary school onwards, almost nothing can be paid for without a debit card and then some experience with independent and safe debit card payments is important. Handling money safely prevents financial problems, according to Nibud. He was supposed to stay in office until 2021, but now World Bank President Jim Yong Kim is abruptly stepping down. The organization did not give a reason, but it was immediately announced that the departing CEO already has a new job. The South Korean-American doctor and anthropologist spent six years at the helm of the World Bank, which is committed to combating poverty worldwide through loans, among other things. \\u201cThe World Bank Group's work is more important than ever as the aspirations of the world's poor rise, and problems such as climate change, pandemics, famine and refugees continue to grow in both scale and complexity,\\u201d Kim said. According to the organization, during his chairmanship he was particularly committed to financing infrastructure projects in collaboration with the business community. That will also be the corner in which he will now continue his work. From February, Kim will start working at a company that focuses on the development of infrastructure in developing countries. More details about this will be announced later. The decline in the percentage of children being vaccinated appears to be coming to a halt. State Secretary Blokhuis wrote this to the House of Representatives. \\u201cAlthough these signals are hopeful, this does not mean that we no longer have work to do,\\u201d he reports. Preliminary figures for 2018 show that approximately as many small children have received their DKTP injection as in 2015. But the percentages are still below the safety limit of 95. Then the risk of infection for everyone is virtually zero. According to Blokhuis, the decline in the vaccination of 12 and 13-year-old girls against cervical cancer has also stopped. But the vaccination rate is still low. In 2018, only 45.5 percent was achieved, while that was 61 percent in 2016. Blokhuis continues his offensive against anti-vaccination stories and vaccination refusers. Parents who refuse to vaccinate their child are invited for a consultation with a youth doctor or a youth nurse about the usefulness and necessity of vaccination for the health of their child and other children. In this special, NPO Focus examines the most frequently heard objections to vaccinations. Staatsbosbeheer donates some of the meat from shot red deer from the Oostvaardersplassen to the food bank. The meat is divided into 8,000 packages of 250 grams. Staatsbosbeheer started shooting more than 1,800 red deer in the nature reserve in December. The population has become too large. Some of the deer shot are not used for consumption, but are left behind as food for other animals. Shooting the deer is slower than intended. To catch up, Staatsbosbeheer will now hunt on more days and times. Shooting will continue until April 1 and then again in September. The shot red deer that are suitable for consumption are gutted and stored in a cold room that has been specially placed in the nature reserve. A wholesaler then collects the animals and processes the meat further. \\\"The judge has decided that the deer could be shot. We would be very sorry if we were to remain on the sidelines and the animals were thrown away. We have a company that can make them available for consumption,\\\" explains the owner of the wholesale. We previously wrote an article about what happens to the antlers, skin and meat of deer. Read the explanation here Staatsbosbeheer wants the meat to be available to everyone and has therefore decided to donate a portion to the food bank. According to a spokesperson for Staatsbosbeheer, they had to think about the offer at the food bank. \\\"A large number of the food bank's customers have never eaten deer. But if it were clearly explained how to prepare it, they would find it interesting.\\\" According to Staatsbosbeheer, the money that the wholesaler pays for the deer is reinvested in the Oostvaardersplassen. The meat also goes to restaurants and poultry shops. Consumers could buy the meat via a special site, but everything has now been sold out. See here how the animals shot from the cold store, via the processor, ultimately end up in the kitchen: Berend te Voortwis from the website is happy with the sale of the meat. \\\"We often talk about preventing food waste in the Netherlands. We think it makes sense to offer the meat, which would otherwise go to the rendering company, for consumption. It is very high-quality meat.\\\" In the Netherlands there is already experience with shooting and processing deer. Most come from the Veluwe and the Amsterdam Water Supply Dunes. At first glance, everything seems to be back to normal on St. Maarten, almost a year and a half after Hurricane Irma left a devastating trail across the island. Tourists, the main source of income for the island, are on the beach as usual. Cruise ships dock in the port and a number of hotels have almost been rebuilt. But if you look beyond the boulevard, you get a completely different picture. \\\"An incredible amount of progress has been made here in a year and a half. But a lot still needs to be done. There are still families living under a leaking roof. And no one knows exactly how many houses are involved,\\\" says Jeroen Pauw. Pauw visits Sint Maarten to investigate what has happened so far with the 550 million euros that the Dutch government made available for reconstruction and the almost 20 million euros that were raised through a national fundraising campaign by the Red Cross. In 'Pauw op Sint-Maarten', tonight at 10.13 pm on NPO 1, an extensive report of Jeroen Pauw's visit to Sint Maarten. He visits residents affected by Hurricane Irma, which hit the island on September 6, 2017. He also looks at projects that are financed with Dutch money and speaks with Prime Minister Leona Marlin-Romeo of Sint Maarten and with Frans Weekers, who assesses the projects on behalf of the Netherlands. The Netherlands demanded that the money be spent responsibly, transparently and without corruption on the rapid reconstruction of the island. That is why 470 million of the 550 million euros were deposited into a World Bank trust fund, which decides which projects are financed. In practice, it takes a lot of time due to all kinds of preceding procedures. But a small part of the available money has now been spent. At the end of last year, the Court of Audit released a critical report on the slow pace of reconstruction. \\\"Because everything has to be done through the official channels, it often takes a long time before anything happens for ordinary people,\\\" says Pauw. \\\"But many people I spoke to on Sint Maarten understand that it goes through the World Bank. The government might otherwise have spent it on other things: large buildings, megalomaniac projects, and not on their roof. Then it just takes a while.\\\" longer, they say.\\\" See below how Jeroen Pauw experienced his trip to Sint Maarten: The Red Cross spent part of the 20 million euros raised on emergency aid and has been supporting people with the repairs of their homes since last summer. There is a serious lack of contractors and construction workers on Sint Maarten, which is why many residents have started working themselves. \\\"People receive vouchers with which they can purchase building materials through the Red Cross and they are given explanations on how they can then repair their roof themselves. I believe that works quite well,\\\" says Pauw. But not everyone is able to repair a roof themselves. And many, whose roof and entire house are damaged, still have to wait for help. On the island, Pauw meets Frans Weekers, former State Secretary of Finance, who sits on the steering group of the World Bank trust fund on behalf of the Netherlands. Weekers is satisfied with the cooperation with the government of the new Prime Minister Leona Marlin-Romeo. \\\"She does an excellent job, but she has to work in a politically difficult situation.\\\" \\\"There are also people on the island who have a financial interest in being able to do whatever they want. That there is no public tendering, that contracts can be given to friends. Then they can also earn something from it. There there is just a lot of corruption. We don't want that. We set the bar high.\\\" Money from the trust fund must be used to find a long-term solution for 'the dump', the large smoldering waste mountain in the middle of the capital Philipsburg. There is hardly any control over the waste that everyone has been dumping here for free for years, including the rubble left over after Hurricane Irma. The stinking mountain poses a threat to public health. People live on the edge of the mountain in great poverty, often illegal immigrants, to whom the aid money will probably never reach, Pauw thinks. The continuously smoldering fires on the mountain must be extinguished and a proper waste disposal system must be established. That's going to take a while. \\\"Ultimately it is an autonomous island, the government here is responsible,\\\" says Weekers. \\\"But we can help the decent parties on this island to rebuild it decently.\\\" At the current pace, the reconstruction of Sint Maarten will not be completed before the new hurricane season arrives in a few months. \\\"That is worrying,\\\" says Pauw. \\\"It is the irony of life: it is always the weak who are not ready. That is also the case here on Sint Maarten.\\\" The government is allocating an additional 1 million euros for aid to Venezuela. The money goes to the Red Cross, which opened giro number 5125 last week for aid to Venezuela and surrounding countries. The money is in addition to the 600,000 euros that the Netherlands already made available last year to help Venezuelans. Venezuela is in financial ruin. The United Nations estimates that more than three million Venezuelans have fled their country due to the political and economic crisis. They flee to countries such as Colombia, Peru, Ecuador or Brazil, fleeing poverty, food shortages, poor health care and repression. It is currently the largest refugee and migration flow in South America. Cura\\u00e7ao also has to deal with thousands of Venezuelan refugees. The additional money is intended to help Venezuelans with temporary shelter and sanitation, food, clean drinking water and medical care. The Red Cross also wants to increase safety for women and children and help families who have lost each other find each other. Tomorrow, KWF Cancer Control will start an online campaign to convince parents of 12 and 13-year-old girls to have their daughters vaccinated against the HPV virus. The organization says that the HPV shot can prevent hundreds of illnesses and deaths. The injection reduces the risk of cervical cancer by 75 percent. Currently, less than half of 14-year-old girls have been vaccinated. KWF director Johan van de Gronden thinks this is a worrying number: \\\"Prevention is always better than cure. We can prevent the suffering that cancer causes with an injection.\\\" Van de Gronden also addresses the concerns of many parents: \\\"There are many myths circulating about this subject. There are no significant side effects; getting cancer is much more drastic.\\\" The fables that Van de Gronden refers to are the stories that circulate about the side effects of the vaccination, including severe fatigue and headaches. However, the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) found no link with the vaccine. The World Health Organization also says that the vaccine provides good protection against the development of cervical cancer. Last year, the RIVM warned of the risk of dozens of additional, unnecessary deaths from cervical cancer. Girls who are 16 years old and have not been vaccinated against HPV will receive a reminder call and can still get the shot. The House of Representatives wants more to be done to convince parents to have their children vaccinated against various diseases, because the vaccination rate has fallen in recent years. Whooping cough and measles have reappeared in the Netherlands. State Secretary for Health Blokhuis (Christian Union) wants to have in-depth conversations with parents. The SP, among others, thinks that is not enough: \\\"Show what happens if you don't vaccinate. What a child who is covered in measles or has had mumps looks like and what this then does to people.\\\" The House of Representatives has been debating this subject since 11:00 am. HPV stands for human papillomavirus, a virus that can cause cervical cancer and related cancers, such as mouth and throat cancer. The virus is contagious and common. About 8 in 10 sexually active women will get an HPV infection at some point in their lives. You often do not notice an infection with HPV. Your body usually clears this virus itself within two years. If the virus is not broken down by the body, there is a chance that the virus will eventually cause cervical cancer. In the Netherlands, more than 750 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer every year and 200 women die from this disease. Since 2009, girls aged 12 and 13 have been invited to get two free vaccinations. VVD, PvdA, GroenLinks and SP want the cabinet to quickly examine far-reaching measures to increase the number of vaccinations against childhood diseases. As far as the VVD is concerned, fining parents who do not have their children vaccinated is also an option. According to that party, the government should consider whether, for example, child benefit or other allowances can be cut. This is already happening in Australia. The House wants the government to quickly investigate more far-reaching measures so that they can be deployed if necessary. For example, if the vaccination rate drops even further, or in the event of an outbreak. This way, action can be taken more quickly. The number of vaccinated children in our country is now below the critical 95 percent, namely 92 percent. This increases the risks and the House is very concerned about this. If the number of children vaccinated against serious diseases rises above 95 percent, the chance of further infection is almost zero. As far as the House is concerned, that is where things should go and that is why more measures must be examined than what the government has come up with so far. The government wants to convince parents through conversations with childcare center employees. A team on social media will also actively respond to nonsense stories about the possible dangers of vaccinations. The group of parents who believe that vaccinations are dangerous, can be fatal and can also cause autism is growing. In the Netherlands, children are vaccinated for these diseases: (source: National Vaccination Program) As far as the VVD is concerned, the cabinet must examine all the pros and cons of reducing child-related allowances, such as child benefit, when parents refuse to vaccinate their child against infectious diseases. Access to a daycare center or kindergarten must also be investigated. In Australia, a daycare center can be fined if it admits an unvaccinated child. VVD MP Veldman: \\\"We must be prepared to think about far-reaching measures, which we hope we will ultimately never have to implement. We do protect children with bicycle helmets and taped sockets. It is bizarre that there are parents who do not protect them against deadly diseases\\\". The cabinet will investigate the matters suggested by the House, but, says State Secretary Blokhuis, \\\"that does not mean that we will do it all.\\\" He himself has more confidence in the route of more and better communication. The House also thinks that general practitioners should be more involved in this. \\\"I understand that thought,\\\" says Blokhuis, \\\"it can certainly make sense. But general practitioners also have a lot on their plate. We will have to carefully discuss the role they could play.\\\" A number of parliamentary groups hope that the cabinet will include the vaccination against meningococcal B in the national programme, as is happening in England. According to the Health Council, it is not yet clear whether the vaccination is effective and there are also risks. But the increasing number of cases is worrying MPs. In a month, Blokhuis will respond to the health council's advice. It must then also become clear what the position is on giving the HPV vaccine to boys, which could prevent infections with cervical cancer. There will be an 'emergency stop procedure' for people with debts who cannot pay a fine and are subsequently confronted with an increase in that fine. Such an increase can now reach 200 percent within a few months, causing even more problems for people. Minister Dekker said in a debate in the House of Representatives that it benefits no one to insist on paying a very high fine if someone wants to but cannot pay. He believes that such a person should be able to go to his municipality and get help. Dekker responded to a plan by the government parties D66 and CDA. They want the accumulation of fines due to late payment to be tackled. The other two parties look at it differently. The Christian Union believes that action should only be taken if a second, new fine - for a different violation, which also cannot be paid - is imposed. The VVD believes that people should simply stick to the rules. The Minister for Legal Protection agrees. He calls a fine \\\"avoidable\\\". \\\"If you don't want that accumulation of fines, you have to make sure you don't get a fine,\\\" he said. But he worries about people who really can't pay and are already up to their necks in debt. He is willing to accommodate this, on the condition that they immediately cooperate in debt assistance. Van Ark announced a number of temporary emergency measures yesterday. Among other things, she wants an end to the option for the Tax Authorities to automatically write off 500 euros for people with problematic debts on January 1, 2020. These measures have been taken to quickly do something for people with high debts and a low income, who have too little left to live on. In the meantime, we are waiting for the Seizure-Free Fee Simplification Act, which should ensure that people have at least 90 percent of the statutory minimum income to live on after seizure by creditors. This still often goes wrong, because the scheme is complicated and agencies work at cross-purposes. People then fall below the subsistence minimum. The law was already passed by the House of Representatives and Senate in 2017, but has not yet been introduced. In January, Van Ark asked for another two years of patience, because the Tax Authorities and the UWV do not yet have their automation systems in order. The measures she announced yesterday are intended to alleviate the need in the meantime. The yellow vests who demonstrated in front of the NOS building this afternoon do not feel heard. The topics on which they do not feel heard vary. For example, Miquel Engelen (49), captain of sailing ships, feels ignored by the media. \\\"If you don't come to us, we will come to you. We are part of a very dissatisfied population that sees things being broken.\\\" Maurice Fonhof (56) wore a cow suit, because he feels milked by Rutte. Fonhof believes that NOS should pay more and different attention to the movement. \\\"There is a whole shift going on in politics. Left-right no longer exists, it has now become yellow.\\\" There are people in The Hague who no longer have any interest in them, says Fonhof. \\\"They are messing things up. We just want a binding referendum.\\\" In this video, Miquel Engelen, Maurice Fonhof and two other demonstrators explain why they came to the NOS in Hilversum today: Corrie van de Veen (48), who volunteers in a hospital, thinks that items about yellow vest demonstrations in France are mainly negative. \\\"The NOS and other media only show the riots and the riot police.\\\" Van de Veen also believes that Dutch people are being 'caught'. \\\"We have less and less to spend. I have had a rich life, but after my divorce three years ago I lost everything and ended up in homeless shelters. Fortunately, I now have a house again.\\\" Jerry Bielsma (63), metro driver in Amsterdam, hopes that with more attention the movement will appeal to a larger audience. \\\"It is really a shame that the Dutch population cannot get off the couch. The government is only pushing people into poverty.\\\" Bielsma would like to retire, but has to work a few more years. In silent protest, he has been growing his hair since the day he was originally supposed to retire. The meat from deer shot from the Oostvaardersplassen has become more expensive. According to the seller, the price per kilo should increase by 2.50 euros because eviscerating the deer is more expensive for Staatsbosbeheer. Evisceration is the removal of the intestines of game. This must be done quickly because the intestines contain bacteria that promote decay. With the mild weather of the last few days, the chance of this is greater. After evisceration, the carcasses are stored in a cold room. A game wholesaler then collects the meat and allows it to mature for two weeks, after which it is inspected by the regulator NVWA. \\\"It is a new sport for us,\\\" says a spokesperson for Staatsbosbeheer. \\\"That's why we couldn't properly estimate how much time and people we would spend on the job. That turned out to be more than expected.\\\" The number of people deployed varies per day. Wildlife managers are needed for shooting and buddies for transport from the field to the work shed. It is a large area, so transportation takes relatively long. \\\"In the beginning, not many animals were shot per day, but now they are. This means that many people have to be called on such a day, because the work is labor intensive. In recent weeks, eight men have been eviscerated every day.\\\" That takes five to ten minutes per deer. Flevoland decided in July 2018 that the number of red deer in the Oostvaardersplassen should be reduced by more than 1,800 to 490. Staatsbosbeheer started shooting the animals in December. A small proportion of deer shot remain in the area as food for other animals, such as foxes and ravens. The remaining meat is donated to food banks, but also sold to the catering industry and to private individuals. Consumers can buy a 2 kilo or 4 kilo meat package online every Monday via koopeenhert.nl. The first packages were sold last month. They were gone within two hours. The meat from 257 deer has now been sold, writes Omroep Flevoland. 15 to 20 kilos of meat can be obtained from each animal. The last sales round is expected to be on April 1. At the invitation of Mayor Aboutaleb, King Willem-Alexander visited the Bospolder-Tussendijken district in Rotterdam-West, which is known as one of the poorer neighborhoods in the city. The municipality decided a few years ago to tackle the neighborhood after the discovery of a large batch of ammunition intended for terrorist activities in France. The king was briefed on this and walked around with Aboutaleb and city marine Danielle van den Heuvel, responsible for the approach. During the walk he also spoke with residents who are trying to improve the neighborhood together with the city marine. Willem-Alexander thanked them for their efforts. Aboutaleb decided on the project when he visited the neighborhood after the discovery of the ammunition and heard from a resident that he did not even know what was going on in BoTu, as the residents call the neighborhood. To find out, he took night walks, between 1 a.m. and 2:30 a.m. There he saw how people at night thought that \\\"they can subjugate the city to themselves.\\\" The mayor walked incognito into four buildings in a row where official foundations were located. \\\"Then I took off my hat and you heard everywhere: 'Aboutaleb, Aboutaleb, Aboutaleb.' Cash registers started ringing, doors closed, administration was secured... So they were all gambling halls. They are all gone now.\\\" Seven businesses have already closed on Mathenesserweg in recent years. Activities took place in many buildings that did not correspond with the permit issued. Safety has now improved. Loitering youth are gone, there is less parking nuisance and residents say they feel safer. The municipality now focuses mainly on social interventions: tackling poverty and domestic violence and better education and homework support for children. Homes are also being renovated. For example, there are moldy apartments that are not suitable for habitation, some buildings still have a geyser for hot water and many homes are too small. According to Aboutaleb, there are still years to go to further improve the neighborhood. In the near future, rogue entrepreneurs will be tackled in other parts of the district, next to Mathenesserweg. The ambition is that BoTu will soon be an average neighborhood in a large Dutch city. More and more self-employed people are at risk of falling below the poverty line, while the number of workers who fall below the poverty line has actually fallen in recent years. This is evident from research by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). According to Statistics Netherlands, someone runs the risk of poverty if, as a single person, he or she earns less than 1,040 euros net, or 1,960 euros for a couple with children. In 2013, there were almost 250,000 workers with such a low income. In four years this fell to 188,000. From 2013, the share of self-employed people at risk of falling into poverty also decreased, but in 2017 it grew again. 2017 is the last year for which Statistics Netherlands has figures. According to CBS chief economist Peter Hein van Mulligen, it is remarkable that the incomes of the ever-growing group of self-employed people are lagging behind. \\\"The income of self-employed people is always a bit more erratic than that of employees, because the number of assignments fluctuates, but self-employed people usually benefit slightly more from economic growth than regular employees. That effect now seems to be absent.\\\" In addition to self-employed people, workers with a non-Western background, the less educated and single people are also at greater risk of ending up below the poverty line. It continues to push and pull with Eelde airport. Should we expand or not? Provincial politics is divided. Sometimes a provider joins, but with the same ease another leaves and the situation quickly becomes dire. You park your car opposite the airport building and within fifty steps you are at the check-in desk. This is Groningen Airport Eelde (GAE). An oasis of peace compared to the hectic pace of Schiphol, for example. Ideal for travelers who leave for a city trip to London on a Monday morning. \\\"We come from Stadskanaal, which is half an hour away,\\\" says a father who is going to London for a few days with his son from group 8. It is the first time that they fly from Eelde. Grandpa, who brought the two, has flown from all kinds of airports, from Bremen to Maastricht, but never from Eelde. \\u201cYou can't go to the cities I want to go to.\\u201d When the plane has taken off, the airport seems deserted again. The restaurant is empty. It is busier in the summer months: charter flights also depart to a number of holiday destinations in Europe. And from this week there will be a scheduled service with Copenhagen again. The idea is that from Eelde you can travel all over the world with one transfer. The owners of the airport have regularly had to pull their wallets to keep things afloat financially. Groningen (city and province together) is the largest stakeholder with 56 percent of the shares. The rest of the shares are held by Drenthe (30), Assen (10) and the municipality of Tynaarlo (4). The province of Groningen therefore has a significant say and as a result the parties participating in the State elections also pay the necessary attention to it in their programs. And it is also a file where there is really something to choose from. CDA, VVD, PVV and Groninger Belang believe that Eelde should remain and, better yet, grow. This includes terms such as core facility (CDA), important airport (VVD) and opportunities for business (Groninger Belang). The Christian Union and PvdA recognize the importance of an airport in the north, but they do believe that air traffic must be made more sustainable. D66, the SP and the Party for the North do not want to spend another cent on the airport: if there are shortages, the business community will have to step in. GroenLinks believes it is irresponsible to continue subsidizing one of \\\"the most polluting modes of transport\\\". The Party for the Animals goes one step further: the province must sell its shares as quickly as possible. Bowy Odink is commercial manager of Groningen Airport Eelde. He does not find it strange that the airport partly lives on government support. \\\"70 percent of all airports in the world receive subsidies. So the situation here is not unique, especially if you see Eelde as part of a basic infrastructure.\\\" Jan Wittenberg wholeheartedly disagrees with this. He is chairman of the Association of Residents of Eelde Airport. \\\"The fact that 7 million euros of taxpayers' money goes to this airport every year is beyond words. Groningen is the poorest province in the Netherlands: 7 percent of the population lives below the poverty line. There is no money for a library and a swimming pool, but for this prestige project.\\\" According to him, the airport cannot be made profitable: \\\"All travelers from the three northern provinces together make 2.5 million flights per year. Only 4 percent of these depart from Eelde. You can be at Schiphol in 2 hours, soon you will be in a hour at Lelystad airport. Eelde has no future.\\\" Odink has more confidence in his airport: \\\"Traveler numbers are growing and 30 percent of passengers are incoming traffic. These are people who spend their money here. And furthermore, 30 percent of travelers on scheduled flights are business. These are entrepreneurs and it The business climate will be better if there is an airport here.\\\" The five shareholders of Groningen Airport Eelde are the same ones who also have to make the political decisions about the airport and in 2017 they decided to see it through for another 10 years. Odink is therefore not very concerned about the outcome of the March 20 elections. \\\"Politics is of course constantly changing, but so far I have heard no other reports than that they are staying the course.\\\" In the run-up to the Provincial Council elections on March 20, NOS will report stories from all twelve provinces. Here you will find all the stories together. Today's story comes from Groningen. The Provincial Council has 43 seats in that province. They are currently divided among 11 factions. The parties SP, CDA, D66, GroenLinks and ChristenUnie obtained enough votes for a majority in previous elections and form the Board of Provincial Executive. 14 parties are participating in the upcoming elections in Groningen. Twelve of these are national political parties. The two other parties are Groninger Belang and Party for the North. Want to know more about the battle in Groningen?

The increase was 6 percent. Every week, approximately 140,000 people collect a package from a food bank in their hometown. \\\"The admission standards have been relaxed. This largely explains the increase in the number of customers,\\\" says a spokeswoman for Food Banks Netherlands, which manages around 500 distribution points. \\u201cAnd we are doing everything we can to lower the barrier for people to enter.\\u201d More and more food banks resemble a supermarket and that makes it less uncomfortable for people. \\\"People can take items from the compartments themselves. For example, they can choose four pieces of vegetables or breakfast products,\\\" says the spokeswoman. Every year, customers collect around 74 million euros worth of food. The number of volunteers has also increased by 6 percent, to 11,700. However, the Food Banks still need extra people, especially for organizational matters. But there is also a shortage of drivers. That is why the website werkenbijvoedingbanken.nl was launched. The Food Bank hopes that the number of volunteers will also increase this year. \\\"Fortunately, our reputation is good and the cuddle factor is high.\\\" About 100,000 girls who will turn 13 this year have been urged to be vaccinated against the HPV virus, which can lead to cervical cancer. More than a thousand of these girls were expected today in a gym in Amersfoort on the first major HPV vaccination day of this year. But the question is whether they all came; last year more than half of the girls called did not show up. Turnout had been declining for some time; the vaccination rate fell from 61 percent in 2015 to 45.5 percent in 2017. As a result, dozens of fewer cases of cervical cancer are prevented per year of birth, says the RIVM. In the Netherlands, 700 women are now diagnosed with cervical cancer every year. 200 of them die from the disease. The vaccine against the HPV virus that can cause this disease has been available since 2006 and has been included in the National Vaccination Program in the Netherlands since 2009. The vaccination reduces the risk of developing cervical cancer by 70 to 80 percent. The vaccination is voluntary and free. The vaccine also protects against other forms of cancer, such as cancer of the vagina, labia, anus, penis, oral cavity, throat and esophagus. The girls who do not get vaccinated say they are concerned about alleged side effects of the vaccine. There are dozens of stories about this on the internet, which are often told in schools. For example, it is claimed that the vaccine leads to chronic fatigue complaints, but various studies, including in the Netherlands, have found no link between fatigue complaints and the vaccination. To better inform children, the biology institute NIBI has developed a special biology lesson that schools can offer. This is now happening at about 30 to 50 schools. One of those schools is the Veenendaal Christian School Community, where biology teacher Swanet van Grootveld gives a special lesson about HPV. \\\"The intention of the lesson package is that students can make a choice whether or not to be vaccinated based on the information they receive,\\\" says Van Grootveld. \\\"Now it often comes down to the parents whether they are going to do it or not. So they don't think about it themselves, but do what their parents say. I do think that this allows them to talk to their parents at home. \\\" Are we all the same, just slightly different? At least on a genetic level. People have 99 percent the same DNA. But the one percent that remains can differ from person to person and partly depends on the ancestors someone has. It is precisely those small pieces of DNA that can have a major influence, for example on the chance that someone will develop a certain disease or be unable to tolerate certain foods. That is why it is important that many different people participate in genetic research. And that is the problem, say American researchers in the scientific journal Cell. They argue for more diversity among participants in such studies. Worldwide, mainly people with European ancestors participate in genetic research. On average, 80 percent of a research population is European. Only 2 percent of the participants have African ancestors and only 1 percent have roots in South America. That is why Africans and South Americans hardly benefit from genetic research. A disease that can be quickly discovered in a Dutch person thanks to such research may be missed in a Brazilian. Scientists have known about the problem for years, but little has been done about it so far. Martina Cornel, professor of Genetics and Public Health at Amsterdam UMC, supports the call of her colleagues. In the Netherlands, too, scientists and physicians occasionally encounter the consequences of little knowledge about diversity in genetics, she says in the NPO radio program Nieuws en Co. \\\"For example, there was an incident with an asylum seeker who had developed severe anemia from eating broad beans. He had a specific genetic abnormality that is rare in people in the Netherlands, but much more common in Syria. If research had shown this, his anemia would have could possibly be prevented.\\\" Another example is research that Cornel herself did, in which she discovered that the test used in the Netherlands to diagnose cystic fibrosis worked less well in Dutch people with a Turkish or Moroccan background. \\\"This is because the test is based on variants that are relatively common in a European group of participants. So you cannot simply use that test more broadly.\\\" According to Cornel, the lack of diversity in genetic research is partly due to laziness on the part of scientists. \\\"People with a European background and those with higher education are more likely to register for scientific research, because they are well aware of the importance. People for whom the language is a problem and those with lower education do so much less.\\\" In addition, according to the professor, it is sensitive to ask people about their origins. And sometimes people have a good reason not to participate: \\\"In the United States, researchers have actively approached African Americans in the past, for example in studies of sickle cell disease and syphilis. Those participants subsequently found out that they would not be treated were no longer allowed to practice certain professions because of their condition or based on the results. They suffered more disadvantages than benefits from their participation.\\\" What needs to be done to turn the tide? According to Cornel, scientists should consciously look for participants with non-Western ancestors. In the Netherlands, subsidies and regulations could help with this. \\\"In the United States, the requirement is that at least 10 percent of participants in genetic studies must have a migration background.\\\" Exchanging research data between scientists from different countries is also part of the solution. \\u201cIf research takes place in Mexico and we can also use that data, we will get a more complete picture,\\u201d says Cornel. \\u201cA lot of people benefit from that.\\u201d The general public will not immediately know his name, but colleagues react with shock to the death of the American economist Alan Krueger (58). A very inspiring scientist who conducted groundbreaking research, according to Coen Teulings, professor of economics in Cambridge and Utrecht and an acquaintance of colleague Krueger. \\\"He was broadly interested and had a nose for important questions.\\\" \\\"He made life better for millions of people who will never know his name,\\\" Larry Summers, former Treasury Secretary and former president of Harvard, wrote in an obituary. \\\"He was perhaps the most interesting and influential labor economist of the past forty years.\\\" Minimum wages in hamburger restaurants, poverty among terrorists, the revenue model of pop artists, Uber taxis. The labor economist, who died on Saturday, was able to ask interesting questions about a wide variety of research areas. \\\"If you gave him a dataset, he wanted to know what new knowledge it provided,\\\" says Teulings. In 1993, Krueger caused a stir among economists with a study of the U.S. minimum wage. Against all dominant economic theories, he and colleague David Card showed that a wage increase actually led to more jobs. For the study, Krueger had looked at what happened when New Jersey raised its minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.05. He compared figures on the number of employees at fast-food restaurants with those in neighboring Pennsylvania, where wages remained the same. The expectation that the more expensive employees would be less popular was refuted. Job growth was actually greater in more expensive New Jersey. Over the years, Krueger has investigated, for example, why poverty is transmitted from generation to generation or what the effect of education is on income. He reasoned that terrorists are not driven by poverty or ignorance at all (perpetrators are often doctors or engineers, Krueger noted) and he showed how income from concerts became more important to artists than record sales. What was revolutionary was that Krueger tested his hypotheses in practice. Labor market researcher with a test tube, De Volkskrant called him in a profile. \\\"His goal was really to learn something from empiricism. 'Guys, we always think this, but let's find out what it really is,'\\\" Teulings says about him. He cites the minimum wage study as an example of such a natural experiment in a field where theory has predominated. \\\"He was constantly dealing with those kinds of situations that suddenly arise, where you can suddenly separate cause and effect.\\\" His love for practice also led Krueger to interrupt his academic career several times for jobs in the economics field. He served as an advisor to Presidents Clinton and Obama and was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. \\\"Krueger was a Democrat through and through,\\\" Teulings explains. \\\"He was genuinely concerned about the direction of American democracy and income inequality in the US. There are economists you can only talk to about academic journals, but he had a keen eye for what was happening in society.\\\" \\\"Alan looked deeper than the numbers on a screen or the diagrams on a page,\\\" former President Obama also said in response to Krueger's self-chosen death. \\\"For him, economic policy was not about abstract theories, but was a way to improve people's lives.\\\" According to the Woonbond, the interest group for tenants, approximately 300,000 tenants can request a rent freeze or reduction. These are people in social housing with a low income and a high rent, the so-called expensive skew tenant. In December, the Woonbond concluded the Social Housing Agreement with the umbrella organization of housing associations Aedes. In it they agreed that this group of tenants must be compensated for the significant rent increases in recent years. \\\"For the largest group, this concerns a rent freeze,\\\" says a spokesperson for the Woonbond. As of today, tenants who want to check whether they are eligible for a reduction or freeze can go to the Woonbond website for a check. According to the association, hundreds of people have already done this this morning. \\\"It was so busy that we had to purchase extra server space because the site crashed,\\\" says the Woonbond spokesperson. In short, three answers can emerge from the test: right to freeze, right to reduction or right to nothing. Tenants with a low income and a rent of more than 720.42 euros per month can request a reduction. Tenants who are entitled to housing allowance but pay a rent that is higher than the so-called capping limit (depending on family size 607 euros or 651 euros) can apply for a freeze. \\\"We are not yet experiencing a storm with applications,\\\" says Stefan Schaik, director of the North Holland housing association Wooncompagnie. \\\"But that is not surprising. People can only request a freeze or reduction if they have received a letter about the rent increase. We send out those letters within two weeks.\\\" Annual letters about rent increases will also be sent out at other corporations in the coming weeks. The corporations must formally report the increases before May 1. The agreements between the Woonbond and Aedes do not mean that every corporation must participate in the campaign. \\\"The agreements have not yet been incorporated into legislation,\\\" says a spokesperson for the Woonbond. \\\"But we assume that almost all cooperatives affiliated with the umbrella organization will participate.\\\" The umbrella organization of housing associations Aedes indicated during the day that the associations do not yet have to adhere to the agreement that has been concluded. This makes it uncertain for tenants how their association will respond to the request. Look here for more information. Housing associations do not have to cooperate in rent reductions or rent freezes for so-called expensive skewed tenants. This is reported by the umbrella organization of housing associations Aedes. The Housing Association announced this morning that 300,000 tenants with a low income and an expensive corporation home are eligible for a reduction or freeze in their rent. The association even came up with an online calculation tool that has been used many thousands of times today. Aedes seemed overwhelmed by the Woonbond's action. The umbrella organization took hours to respond and subsequently wrote in a press release that a temporary rent reduction or freeze is not possible because it first requires a change in the law. The Woonbond calls Aedes' statement \\\"patently untrue\\\". It seems that the housing associations are backtracking, says director Paulus Jansen. \\\"We had an agreement, which Aedes signed last December. If tenants receive no response from their corporations, Aedes has a problem with us.\\\" The Ministry of the Interior has announced that corporations are free to reduce or freeze rents. However, this does limit the options for corporations to quickly increase the rent again. The disagreement means great uncertainty for the tenants. Thousands of tenants used the calculation tool this morning to see whether they are eligible for a rent reduction or rent freeze. They thought they could then report to their housing association. But according to Aedes, he doesn't have to do anything with that. \\\"The choice lies with the individual corporations,\\\" says an Aedes spokesperson. \\\"Rent reduction or rent freezing is possible, but it must be structural. Corporations must see for themselves whether this suits their policy.\\\" Nevertheless, Aedes hopes that all corporations will put the agreements in the Social Rent Agreement into practice as much as possible this year. Packs of drinks, sandwiches and diapers are the first things Gina thinks about when the week starts. \\u201cYou can't send your children to school without bread,\\u201d she says. Gina lives below the poverty line with her husband and three young children. Her children are no exception: one in nine children in the Netherlands lives below the poverty line, that is about 378,000 children. Today, the Child Poverty Alliance, to which various organizations are affiliated, is starting to come up with new solutions to tackle child poverty. Making choices and saying no to her children - a 9-month-old baby, a 6-year-old daughter and her 11-year-old son - is everyday life for Gina. \\u201cIt works every week,\\u201d but it's not easy. \\u201cMy son Manasseh came home one day with the message that his sneakers are too small,\\u201d says Gina. She had to disappoint him, because there was no money for a new pair. \\\"I said, 'I can't arrange it now, but next week we'll buy them.'\\\" She remembers her 11-year-old son's reaction: \\\"Mom, it doesn't matter, I'll wear the shoes that are too small again.\\\" Then it might hurt a little, but I'm willing to pay for it.\\\" In the Child Poverty Alliance, 90 organizations want to work together to come up with new creative and smart solutions to tackle child poverty. The goal is that no child will be affected by poverty by 2030. There should also be no more families in poverty. For example, from 2020, a supermarket will deliver free sandwiches to schools, a publisher will lend out their children's books for free, products will be given to children through foundations or daycare centers and attention will be drawn to the problem in various ways. Gina has always worked, but because she is under the supervision of authorities, she has to hand in her income. She receives living allowance until her debts are paid off. Her debts have piled up over the years, she spent more money than she brought in. \\\"It was partly my own fault that I was in debt.\\\" It didn't help that someone in her life was also spending her money. The debts increased and in 2012 it came under the supervision of the municipality. The first year she tried to support her family with (then) two young children with 50 euros of living allowance per week. She went to the food bank. Because Gina and her children have been under supervision for years, it has become the most normal thing in the world for them to talk about money. Her daughter Victoria asked if she could take swimming lessons, like other children, but that is not an option now. \\\"That is very expensive. My son also had to wait a long time, when he was 7 years old he only started taking swimming lessons. He was among the little ones.\\\" Her 11-year-old son Manasse doesn't really notice that they don't have much at home and thinks it's \\\"just normal,\\\" he says. \\u201cI did wear Crocs for a while,\\u201d he recalls. There was no money for new shoes at the time. \\\"But that doesn't matter, because the weather was nice then.\\\" Together with his mother he explains what goes on in the classroom. Gina: \\\"Sometimes he runs out of calling credit, but of course he has to be able to reach me.\\\" Then he has to ask other classmates to borrow a phone. \\u201cOr I'll just ask the master,\\u201d says Manasseh. Things are better now, but Gina is still under the supervision of a guardian. In recent years her situation has changed. She is married and because her husband also has an income, the five of them now live on 100 euros a week. But because things are improving, there are a number of 'pots' to which she is no longer entitled. Reimbursement for childcare, for example, or money from the Youth Sports Fund. \\\"Fortunately, the Manasse sports club thinks along and we can borrow pants and a shirt.\\\" Gina: \\\"Once the guardianship is stopped, I can manage my own money again.\\\" But for that she has to wait for a judge's decision. She applied in August. Since then she has been waiting for a letter with a signature from the judge. \\\"I look at the mailbox every day and ask: could the letter be in there?\\\" An overwhelming majority in the House of Representatives wants an investigation into the disappearance of dozens of Vietnamese minors from protected reception locations for asylum seekers. This is what the MPs said in response to a broadcast on this subject by the VPRO program Argos this afternoon on NPO Radio 1. It is suspected that the young Vietnamese end up illegally through Vietnamese people smugglers. They would like to escape poverty, especially in the north of Vietnam. Regional police forces in the Netherlands are raising the alarm, internal documents show. \\\"Human trafficking is unacceptable and must be tackled,\\\" says SP MP Jasper van Dijk, who, like GroenLinks, has asked parliamentary questions about the issue. Anne Kuik of the CDA: \\\"It is difficult for a child to stand up against the Vietnamese mafia, but cooperating governments must be able to do so. Research and an international strategy are needed to prevent this exploitation of children.\\\" Other parties in the House of Representatives are also in favor of an investigation. VVD MP Becker says that asylum reception in the Netherlands \\\"should not be a place for human traffickers or a temporary stop on a smuggling route towards an illegal existence\\\". According to Femke Merel van Kooten of the Party for the Animals, \\\"the bottom stone must be raised\\\". Forum for Democracy MP Hiddema believes that the ball is actually in the police's court, but will support a possible investigation in the House of Representatives. \\\"If the police show concern, that is cause for concern. And then there must be an investigation from there.\\\" Like the House of Representatives, National Rapporteur on Human Trafficking Herman Bolhaar is also calling for in-depth research. \\\"This problem has a scale that worries me a lot, both in the Netherlands and internationally. We cannot be reassured without knowing where these children have ended up,\\\" says Bolhaar. The suspected underage Vietnamese have disappeared from protected shelter in recent years, even though they were placed there because they are vulnerable to human smuggling. Structured human trafficking appears to be behind the disappearances, according to documents that Argos requested on the basis of the Public Administration Act (Wob). Those documents have been viewed by the NOS. It explains, among other things, how regional police forces are raising the alarm about disappearances and suspicions of human trafficking. The Limburg police say they want to investigate the underlying organization, but have no capacity to do so. The Expertise Center on Human Trafficking and Human Smuggling has also received several signals about human trafficking since 2016. For example, the center reported in July 2018 that there were indications that the young people were being trafficked to England. The Argos broadcast about the disappeared Vietnamese asylum seekers is from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM on NPO Radio 1. Hungary and France asked Dutch police services to investigate what level of organization they see in Vietnamese people who enter the country through false family connections. And in 2017, the Royal Military Police (KMAR) wrote that there are strong suspicions of human trafficking surrounding the disappearances of Vietnamese foreigners. They therefore want to 'strengthen their information position'. The KMAR writes in 2017: \\\"For a year now, we have been seeing national problems with Vietnamese people who claim to be victims of human trafficking.\\\" And: \\\"There is a suspicion that an organization is behind this.\\\" Aid groups such as Pacific Links have raised similar concerns with the State Department, the documents show. They talk about \\\"organized crime\\\" behind the smuggling of Vietnamese into Europe. In a response, State Secretary Harbers refers to the answers he gave in December to parliamentary questions on this subject. He then said that there is currently no information available to implementation organizations about a smuggling network involved in the disappearance of underage Vietnamese migrants. According to him, previous investigations into this have not revealed any criminal offences. NOS op 3 previously made this video about the concerns surrounding Vietnamese nail salons: Fifteen Dutch hospitals are participating in a study into vaccinating women after a procedure to prevent cervical cancer. The hope is that women will become resistant to the human papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause cervical cancer. An earlier small study showed that women who are already carriers of HPV can also benefit from vaccination. Girls as young as 12 are currently being vaccinated against the sexually transmitted virus. This reduces the risk of developing cervical cancer by 70 to 80 percent. Cervical cancer affects approximately 700 women in the Netherlands every year, of whom 200 die. Hundreds more women undergo medical intervention because troubled cells are discovered in them. These cells are removed to prevent cervical cancer. However, the virus remains present and every time this procedure is done, the risk of premature birth increases. The research, which is being conducted by Franciscus Gasthuis & Vlietland and Erasmus MC in Rotterdam, focuses on women who have already undergone such a medical procedure. It should make them resistant to HPV and thus reduce the risk of cervical cancer, new operations and premature births. 800 women can participate, some of whom will receive a placebo. Troubled cells caused by the HPV virus are not yet cancer, says researcher and gynecologist Ward Hofhuis of the Franciscus Gasthuis on NPO Radio 1. \\\"But I can tell you that women in whom these cells are discovered experience a lot of physical and emotional is stressful. If you can prevent these troubled cells from coming back and also further limit premature births, that is a win.\\\" Changing the names of ministries and redistributing tasks is estimated to cost the government around 31.7 million euros. This is evident from a report by the National Audit Service. The amounts were provided by the ministries themselves. The majority of the costs - around 26.3 million - are borne by the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature Management and Food Quality. Under previous cabinets, 'Agriculture' was part of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. During this cabinet period it has again become a separate ministry. Changing the name of the Ministry of Security and Justice to Justice and Security will cost more than 2 million euros. This includes adjusting the e-mail addresses of employees. Minister Grapperhaus said during Question Time in the House of Representatives that he fully supports the name change. As far as he is concerned, it must be clear that justice comes first. \\\"That is the basic requirement.\\\" When the Rutte III cabinet took office, several changes were implemented at the ministries. For example, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (which also included Agriculture) was called Economic Affairs and Climate. The Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality (LNV) was restored. The Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment became the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management. And at the Ministry of Security and Justice, two words were reversed so that it is now called Justice and Security. Furthermore, the Ministry of the Interior was given a somewhat larger range of tasks, including 'spatial planning'. SP MP Van Raak had called Grapperhaus to Question Time. According to him, the 32 million is a waste of money. In his opinion, it could have been better used, for example, to keep the Bronovo hospital open or to provide children in poverty with new shoes. The Minister of Justice and Security said that rearranging and renaming ministries is timeless. He himself grew up with the Ministry of CRM (Culture, Recreation and Social Work), which was the successor to the Ministry of Social Work. \\\"You also have to follow social developments at ministries,\\\" he said. The report from the National Audit Service dates from October 2018. De Volkskrant wrote about it this morning. Training or keeping dogs in line by shocking them remotely via a collar will no longer be an option from next year. Minister Schouten of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality will ban the use of electric collars on dogs, she writes to the House of Representatives. She wants the ban to take effect on July 1, 2020. According to the minister, it has been found that the electric collar \\\"causes considerable suffering\\\" to the dog. She actually only wanted to come up with stricter rules, but writes that due to new scientific research she is coming up with a total ban. The government is now also using electric collars. Defense and police use them to train sniffer dogs. Defense has now stopped, the police will continue with a limited group of dogs. In the long term, the electric collar will be completely abandoned. The sale of the collars is not restricted, only their use. Dog expert Martin Gaus is happy that electric collars will soon be banned. \\\"If a dog cannot be alone at home, or for example pulls on the leash, an owner wants to unlearn this. But if the animal cannot be alone, he is stressed. If you treat him with an electric shock, he will become even more stressed. , then you make him extremely unhappy,\\\" he says in the NOS Radio 1 Journaal. Gaus himself is not in favor of a total ban. He says that in specific cases the tires can be a solution, for example for training dogs for hunting, but that must be done by experts. \\\"But selling to consumers in the store, no, that is really a taboo.\\\" Minister Schouten will also take action against abuses in the breeding of purebred cats. \\u201cCreating new breeds for human pleasure, without regard to the consequences for the animal, in my opinion, shows no respect for the integrity, well-being and health of the animal,\\u201d she writes. An example of a cat breed where a lot goes wrong is the Bambino Sphynx. The species is often bred in such a way that the animals have too short legs and have difficulty orientating themselves due to the lack of whiskers. A quarter of the animals would already die in the womb. There will be no total ban on the sale of the cat breed. Enforcement of such a ban would be too complicated, the minister said. However, there will be strict criteria that breeders must meet. Bad breeders can be tackled with warnings and fines. Fifteen Dutch companies will together help 3,500 refugees find work at home and abroad. They made that promise at the Dutch Business Summit on Refugees in Amsterdam. Companies also want to make extra emergency aid available to people in refugee camps. Together the companies invest millions in refugee aid. Tent Partnership for Refugees is the organization behind the company agreements. Tent encourages companies worldwide to help refugees. \\\"About 120 companies have now registered with Tent's supporting refugee organization,\\\" the organization said. ING, Philips, Randstad and ABN Amro, among others, are participating. ING will provide a loan of 10 million euros so that Syrian refugees in Turkey can start their own business and hundreds of people will receive training to make their start-up a success. The following companies in the Netherlands have made plans to help refugees: ABN Amro, management consultancy Accenture, consultancy and engineering company Arcadis, cleaning company Asito, service provider Dental Care Professionals, construction company Dura Vermeer, Hilton, technology company HP, ING, Philips, Rabobank, Randstad, Shell, employment company ManpowerGroup and Unilever. \\u201cWhether they are fleeing poverty, war or a natural disaster: an increasing number of refugees from different areas share the same difficulty in connecting to the labor market and gaining access to good, adequate healthcare,\\u201d says Ronald de Jong of the board of directors from Philips. The Eindhoven technology company wants to help one hundred refugees find a job in the Netherlands and Germany within five years. How much money the company is investing in this has not been disclosed. ABN Amro wants to hire more than eighty refugees by 2021, and cleaning company Asito wants to hire at least fifty. Companies want to help refugees find work more quickly. This also seems necessary in the Netherlands. The most recent figures from Statistics Netherlands show that only 11 percent of asylum seekers who received a residence permit here in 2014 had a job within 2.5 years. 84 percent of status holders still received benefits. Nearly 120,000 residence permits were issued between 2013 and 2018. More than half of this went to refugees and people who are at risk if they return to their country of origin. Jobs are not only created in Europe. The vast majority of refugees are outside Europe, the companies say. That is why they also want to help refugees find work in the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. Plans are still being made for this. Attention is also paid to extra assistance for refugees in dire situations. For example, Unilever wants to improve hygiene in Lebanese refugee camps with their soaps. And Philips wants to work with the Philips Foundation to provide medical supplies in the Al-Hol refugee camp in Syria. Shell says it will work on cleaner energy supplies for refugees over the next three years. FC Twente has been saved, and not for the first time. The Enschede city council last night agreed to 14 million euros in support for the club, while also cutting back on social expenditure. And that led to strong reactions, including on the NOS Facebook page. A selection of the texts: \\\"It's bizarre, let that club go bankrupt! Incomprehensible, all tax money!\\\", \\\"Idiotery! The food banks are busy and healthcare is inadequate, but a football club needs to be saved.\\\" Sports economist Tsjalle van der Burg sees a reason why football clubs are often supported. \\\"There is always a lot of pressure from the supporters. If the municipality does nothing, the fans will be on the sidewalk. And then you lose voters.\\\" But that is not the main reason given by Enschede councilor Eelco Eerenberg of Finance. He says that the municipality must step in (\\\"reluctantly\\\") because otherwise the loss will become even greater. \\\"I understand that people think it's enough once, but the club is technically bankrupt. If we had left, we would have lost 25 million.\\\" The municipality had lent that much to the club. The municipal council has its back against the wall, as FC Twente expert Gerben Kuitert from the Tubantia newspaper explains the situation. \\\"If they had said no, millions would have been flushed down the drain.\\\" Van der Burg understands that argument, but believes that the municipality should have been much stricter. \\\"Enschede says they do this so that they get the money back, but they actually cancel a significant part of the debt. That is special.\\\" The municipality immediately waives 5 million euros. Over the years, another 2 million euros will be added. \\\"They have been too generous,\\\" says the sports economist at the University of Twente. \\\"The municipality should have said: we demand a share of the income when things improve again. For example, 25 percent of the TV funds.\\\" According to Tubantia journalist Kuitert, the recent financial problems at the FC have two causes. \\\"They built a stadium there that was too expensive for a provincial club. And they also attracted players that were too expensive, with high salaries. If you add that together, you get into trouble.\\\" These problems ultimately resulted in the Tukkers being relegated from the Premier League in 2018. However, conditions have been set for saving the club. This way, the municipality will be the first to receive the money back from the creditors and no dividend will go to shareholders until the debt has been repaid. It has also been agreed that the club will make almost 2,000 tickets available per season to Enschede residents with little money. And the latter touches on social interests, an argument that is often criticized when it comes to support for football clubs. The councilor is also talking about it. \\\"Twente is a club where a lot of people earn a salary and where many entrepreneurs earn a living. It is also a good brand in the region. That has value.\\\" Van der Burg is not convinced of the city marketing argument, but does see the social value of the football club. \\\"It is there, especially for those thousands of fans. For some of them, the club is really their life.\\\" Normally saving a club is not the task of the municipality, says a fan today at the training field. \\\"But now we do!\\\": What bothers the sports economist is that, according to him, FC Twente has learned nothing from the past. The plan approved by the municipal council mentions investments that it believes are not appropriate. \\\"For example, they want to install solar panels on the roof of the stadium,\\\" says Van der Burg. \\\"A family that is having financial problems because the breadwinner has been fired, wouldn't buy solar panels, would it? No, such a family will be more economical until they get back on their feet.\\\" \\\"But this club is not economical in any way,\\\" he continues. \\\"There is a certain arrogance there: we are FC Twente, we are important. And this is how you maintain that entire culture.\\\" Councilor Eerenberg completely disagrees with this. \\\"There is a frugal budget. The plan is very well thought out and gives Twente room to do what they should be good at. Just play football.\\\" Tubantia journalist Kuitert also believes that the ball is now mainly in the hands of the Twente players. \\\"I don't dare swear that things will work out now. If they stay in the Kitchen Champion Division and everything goes wrong, they could easily turn to the municipality again.\\\" At the moment, Twente has good credentials to return to the highest level: with five games left to play, they are seven points above number 2. In the coming months, 1,000 people in the Netherlands will receive free dental treatment who would otherwise not be able to afford it. Doctors of the World, an organization that is committed to the right to care for everyone, travels the country for this purpose. The kick-off this morning was in Waddinxveen. According to the organization, around 500,000 people in the Netherlands do not have enough money to go to the dentist. Rotten teeth, inflammation and severe pain are the result. Doctors of the World hopes that this action will draw more attention to this problem. That is why the Choosing for Each Other campaign about limited accessibility to oral care will start at the same time. For people over 18 years of age, dental check-ups and many dental treatments are no longer included in the basic health insurance package. Director De Jong of Doctors of the World finds it distressing that approximately half a million people cannot afford necessary treatments. \\\"We see people who can no longer sleep or eat because of the pain. Even some people in their thirties have all their teeth pulled and get dentures to avoid high dental costs.\\\" According to the organization, access to care is a human right and should not be a privilege. The 1,000 people have been selected by community organizations, such as food banks and homeless shelters. In the near future, they will be able to visit the mobile dental clinic in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Nijmegen and Groningen for free oral care. NOS op 3 spoke two years ago with a dentist who helps homeless people and addicts get better teeth for free. \\\"When I see them smiling again, I think: yes, this is all worth it,\\\" says dentist Sharif (26) in the video below. More than a hundred daycare centers throughout the Netherlands say it is their policy to refuse unvaccinated children. This is evident from a survey by the NOS. Twenty-five of them say that they have actually refused children. Refusing unvaccinated children is in principle not permitted in the Netherlands. Daycare centers may not discriminate and make a distinction between children in their recruitment policy. Only if there are very compelling arguments, for example if the health of other children is at risk due to a measles outbreak, can children be excluded, says the Childcare Disputes Committee. A daycare center in The Hague was hit by the highly contagious measles virus earlier this month. This week it was announced that four children under the age of 4 now have the disease. None of the children had been vaccinated, but that is also because some of them are younger than 14 months. That is the age at which children receive the MMR vaccination. The daycare centers that have actually refused unvaccinated children believe that the safety of other children is very important, as is evident from the tour. \\\"We cannot guarantee safety for all children if there are children inside who are not vaccinated,\\\" says the spokesperson for a daycare center from Almere. \\\"As the owner, I can decide for myself who I want as a customer and who I don't want? As the owner of a childcare center, I do not want to be held liable by parents when I expose their young babies to teething diseases,\\\" says the owner of an Amsterdam daycare center. At a Utrecht daycare center, the opinion of other parents also plays a role in the choice to refuse: \\\"Parents ask about the vaccination rate during the tour or registration, and I often notice relief when I can say that everyone has been vaccinated.\\\" Many other daycare centers appear to struggle very much with the theme. Until two years ago, the Smallest Giant in Amsterdam had a policy of refusing unvaccinated children, says owner Susan van Oosterom. When a parent threatened to have a lawyer, they allowed the unvaccinated child anyway. She would still prefer to refuse unvaccinated children, but mainly sees practical objections. \\\"Many parents do not tell us honestly whether their children participate in the vaccination program and we should not oblige parents to submit documents.\\\" At Berend Botje, a childcare organization with 53 branches in the West Friesland region, they have made an inventory of all unvaccinated children. They will decide on Tuesday whether the contract with the parents of approximately ten children will be terminated. \\\"We receive many questions from parents who are concerned because their young children cannot yet be vaccinated. If you refuse a shot against cervical cancer, you are only harming yourself. If you refuse a vaccination against measles, you are endangering others,\\\" said owner Alien Alberts. The Childcare Trade Organization says it is surprised that so many daycare centers refuse children, but the organization understands this. \\\"We know that childcare providers struggle with this problem, because the safety of children in a daycare center is the highest good,\\\" says director Magda Heijtel in the NOS Radio 1 Journaal. According to Heijtel, the solution lies in more information, which should increase the vaccination rate. \\\"The government must communicate more insistently and ensure that the possible negative effects of vaccination are well substantiated and communicated to parents.\\\" Heijtel also says that childcare should not become a plaything of the vaccination policy. \\\"Children come to daycare on average twice a week. The rest of the days they are somewhere else and they can also become infected. The problem is that the vaccination rate in the Netherlands is too low and childcare is not the solution to this problem. \\\" According to the Childcare Disputes Committee, which must judge if parents have a dispute with a childcare facility, there is \\\"in principle no legal basis for a complete refusal of unvaccinated children\\\". In other words: refusing is now not allowed. In special cases, for example in the event of an outbreak of a contagious disease such as measles, the childcare organization may decide to (temporarily) refuse admission to unvaccinated children when the safety and health of the children being cared for is at stake. \\\" But this is only allowed in \\\"an individual case, based on adequate substantiation, in which all interests involved have been weighed.\\\" According to the dispute committee, there must really be something going on. It is ultimately up to the judge or the Childcare Disputes Committee to decide whether there are sufficient grounds for a refusal. State Secretary Tamara van Ark of Social Affairs, who is responsible for childcare, emphasizes in a response that there is no explicit ban anywhere in the law. \\\"It does not appear to be prohibited to refuse children, but there is no clarity about this yet. Ultimately, a judge must always be involved,\\\" she says. However, she believes it is important that there is clarity. She has set up a committee to investigate the legal options. There is also a private member's bill from D66 that attempts to ensure that daycare centers are given the right to refuse children. Van Ark previously called D66's proposal \\\"very interesting\\\" and said she was willing to make it work in practice. \\\"Although we all want a definitive answer to this very quickly, it is very complex,\\\" says Van Ark. \\\"In the meantime, I would say to parents who are concerned, go to your daycare center or local health service.\\\" Based on the vaccination rate in the municipality, the GGD can tell whether parents should be concerned. The NOS sent an email to 3,600 daycare centers this week, promising that their response will be used anonymously. More than 500 responded. The names and locations of the organizations are known to the editors. 105 daycare centers say they have a policy of refusing children who have not been vaccinated. 25 also say that they have actually experienced a situation in which they have not admitted unvaccinated children, or children whose parents did not intend to have their child vaccinated. Students at primary schools in disadvantaged neighborhoods have a much more difficult time than children from regular neighborhoods. That has been the case for some time, but at a Rotterdam school they employ a social worker to change that backlog. The measure is praised. Many students in disadvantaged neighborhoods lag behind in their language skills, they suffer from concentration problems and are more likely to have a learning disability, according to a study among teachers. The sample was commissioned by a number of organizations, including the Youth Education Fund. This image is recognized by all major Dutch educational organizations. Hans Spekman of the Youth Education Fund is enthusiastic about the approach of the Bergkristal in North Rotterdam. There, 75 children attend special primary education and many of them come from a deprived area. How do they work there? The efforts of social worker Philip Pietermaat in particular can count on praise. According to him, the home situation of the students - 70 percent at Bergkristall lives in poverty - has a major influence on their performance at school. He gives the example of a child without a bed. \\\"If a child doesn't have a bed, he or she will sleep poorly. And if a child can't sleep, solving arithmetic problems in class suddenly becomes a difficult task,\\\" says Pietermaat. \\\"What does a child do at school?\\\" Hans Spekman of the Youth Education Fund visits schools where 50 to 70 percent of the students attend aid agencies. \\\"That requires enormous strength from the schools themselves to help quickly. If a child is in class with problems, the child will not learn, but neither will part of the class.\\\" That is why Pietermaat intervenes at appropriate times. In the case of the girl without a bed, he had arranged this within a week. According to director Jonathan de Heer, there were major differences in the girl's grades afterward. \\\"She had a huge growth spurt right after she got a bed.\\\" Everything was done in consultation with support agencies, but especially by maintaining good contact with the parents. According to Pietermaat, it shows that home visits to parents are of vital importance. \\\"If you have their trust, you can really help a child. If you don't have time for that, you have no idea in what situation children grow up.\\\" Pietermaat compares himself to Beau van Erven Dorens. \\\"What he does at RTL, I do every day. That sounds arrogant, but that's how it is.\\\" He is referring to the program The Rotterdam Project, in which Van Erven Dorens helps people out of their dire situations. \\\"I experience all those aspects that are covered in that program and that help people further every day at school.\\\" He mentions a boy who suddenly wanted to leave school. \\\"That boy just bullied him and disrupted the lesson. Luckily I was texted, because you want to keep him at school. That's the only way you can guarantee his safety. I make sure he stays inside and doesn't leave the school. \\\" According to Spekman, immediate action is important to reduce the problems. According to him, a social worker can fill that position perfectly at a primary school. But there are two more measures that Spekman wants from politicians. \\\"You have children who start in group 1 with a vocabulary of 500 words, while the average is 2000. You would immediately have to put hours into that.\\\" Spekman also mentions broadening the living environment of young children. \\\"You see that the living environment threatens to become very narrow for children who no longer come from their own neighborhood. This creates the image among those children that there is no other way and that there are also other children.\\\" According to Spekman, a solution is to take it somewhere with you. \\\"Take those children to a theater performance or the beach. The world is bigger than their own misery.\\\" And that feeling must be reflected in the so-called living room at Bergkristal. There is that comparison with Beau van Erven Dorens again. \\\"The mother of a student was in a refugee shelter. As a result, the child had to travel 45 minutes. Ultimately, it turned out that she had not had breakfast. What is the point of letting such a child go to class? We will then provide a sandwich and a cup of tea. Then we will arrive in class fifteen minutes later. Then we will do the math.\\\" The policy of the Rutte II cabinet to reduce the number of single parents on social assistance seems to be paying off four years later. The number of single parents on social assistance has been decreasing since 2015, according to a report by the social services association Divosa. In November 2014, before the abolition of parental subsidies, the Netherlands still had approximately 87,000 single welfare parents, according to Statistics Netherlands. In February this year there were 72,500. According to the report, the decline can be explained by the abolition of various subsidies for single parents by Rutte II in 2015. Instead, tax schemes have been created that should make working more attractive, so that single parents with part-time work can already exceed the social assistance limit. Hatch. So those financial incentives seem to work. According to de Volkskrant, the decrease will save municipalities around 200 million euros per year. When it comes to singles without children and couples, Divosa still sees an increase in the number of social assistance benefits. Divosa chairman Erik Dannenberg emphasizes that there is still plenty to gain. According to him, social assistance recipients are reluctant to work part-time or flexibly in addition to their benefits. The main reason for this is that they do not understand the consequences for benefits and municipal poverty schemes, says Dannenberg. \\\"People too often choose the security of little instead of the chance of better,\\\" he says. \\\"That is understandable, but also a missed opportunity. It hinders people in their development.\\\" Councilors from VVD, CDA, D66 and Christian Union from all over the country are begging the government for more money for youth care. In an open letter (.pdf) they address their fellow party members in the cabinet and in the House of Representatives. \\\"The stretch has been exhausted. Although we want to do our utmost to support vulnerable children and young people in our cities and villages, we are approaching the limit of what is possible,\\\" says the letter, which has been signed by more than 250 councilors. Four years ago, the municipalities took over the tasks of youth care from the government. The available budget was reduced by 450 million euros, while the demand for care increased. Last week the cabinet promised hundreds of millions more, but the councilors think that is not enough, because demand has also increased. Last week, the Association of Dutch Municipalities (VNG) issued the same cry for help. This is no longer the case, more money is needed, was the call. The councilors wholeheartedly support that call. They also point to other cuts, for example on poverty reduction and sports facilities, all things that they believe care provision should prevent in the future. The VNG and the aldermen are asking for an additional 490 million euros. The councilors not only ask their \\\"Hague\\\" party members for more money, but also argue for a better and more efficient youth care system. But \\\"significant steps\\\" require \\\"sufficient resources\\\", the councilors say. An article by Forum for Democracy leader Baudet in an American political magazine is not well received by VVD, PvdA, D66, SP and GroenLinks. In the piece in American Affairs he seems to speak out against abortion, euthanasia and working women. That rubs some politicians the wrong way. Baudet himself does not understand the fuss. The article, which Baudet also tweeted about, is an essay about the French writer Houellebecq. The Forum leader wonders whether our modern world, with all its achievements and freedoms, makes us happier. He refers, among other things, to abortion and euthanasia. \\u201cToday, new life can be smothered in the womb to avoid interfering with the freedom of the individual.\\u201d D66 leader Jetten believes that the piece shows \\\"the true nature\\\" of Baudet. \\\"That a party that presents itself as liberal rails against achievements. He does not stand for the right to control one's own body. He is much less liberal than he sometimes pretends.\\\" Baudet doesn't understand why people are concerned. \\\"I think it is a beautiful, balanced essay that reflects the thinking of one of the most important authors of our time. Let people read the entire piece and chew on it for a few days and think about it before immediately being indignant again.\\\" Another passage that bothers MPs is about working women. \\u201cThe 'liberated' status of women is celebrated as a triumph of modern society,\\u201d Baudet writes. \\\"Women are encouraged to be financially independent, but working full-time makes supporting a spouse and starting a family difficult. Working, maintaining a relationship and raising children is almost impossible to combine.\\\" He sees a one-to-one relationship with Europe's population decline. D66 MP Dijkstra tweets about this: \\\"We are not going back in time, Thierry.\\\" GroenLinks MP Buitenweg and SP leader Marijnissen agree. \\u201cDear mother, how is it possible that we have to fight for these women's rights again,\\u201d Buitenweg tweets. VVD MP Yesilgoz writes: \\\"Baudet questions the equality between men and women. (....) We women are endangering almost the entire continent of Europe. I actually don't even want to be equal to such a man.\\\" Minister Van Engelshoven of OCW said on Twitter that he was appalled by Baudet's \\\"stupid statements\\\". \\\"I will continue to fight for the financial independence of women so that they can always make their own choices in freedom.\\\" Baudet himself does not want to discuss the questions about his essay in detail. \\\"I think it's a shame that it's about one sentence that is causing a fuss,\\\" he told NOS. But isn't the analysis in the essay his opinion on euthanasia and women's emancipation? \\\"I don't give an opinion at all, I analyze a certain trend, through the eyes of author Michel Houellebecq.\\\" \\\"Baudet pretends that it does not matter that in addition to being an essay writer, he is now also the political leader of the party that became the largest in the last elections. That is of course unjustified,\\\" says political reporter Arjan Noorlander. \\\"The topics he addresses are not included in this way in the Forum for Democracy election manifesto. It is therefore logical that confusion now arises about how Baudet views abortion, euthanasia and women's emancipation, including among his own supporters. The question now is whether Baudet plans to come up with new bills on these themes.\\\" It appears that PvdA has become the largest in the European parliamentary elections: according to the exit poll, the party would get five seats in the European Parliament. This is followed by VVD and CDA with four seats, GroenLinks and Forum for Democracy would end up with three seats. What were the motives for voting or staying at home? The turnout appears to be slightly higher than in the previous elections in 2014, but there are still many Dutch people who indicate that they do not want to vote in these elections. The reasons for this are mainly disinterest and no confidence in European politics. This is evident from a study by Ipsos, commissioned by the NOS. The research agency asked Dutch people about their voting motives and their views on the role of the Netherlands in Europe. Their opinions on, among other things, a nexit, the euro, a European army and labor migration within the EU were asked. Of the people who did not vote today, 43 percent indicated that they did not vote due to disinterest. 27 percent did not vote because they do not trust European politicians. Nearly a third of non-voters have no interest in politics in general, and therefore did not go to the polling station. At least 9 percent also do not vote on principle. Another 9 percent are against the European Union, 17 percent think their vote does not matter. About 14 percent were unable to attend, did not have time or had lost their voting card. The majority of people who did vote today did not vote against the policy of the current cabinet. So there is no clear vote against the Rutte III cabinet. At least 49 percent indicate that the Rutte III cabinet will not play a role in today's party choice. 17 percent said they voted in favor of the current cabinet, 29 percent voted against. The Ipsos online survey is based on a representative sample of 2,564 Dutch voters. The data was collected today. With a sample of this size, and assuming a 95 percent confidence level, the margins of uncertainty range from about 0.5 percent to about 2 percent. For subgroups in the sample (for example voters for a particular party), the margins vary from approximately 2 percent to approximately 6 percent, according to Ipsos. What specifically did the Dutch pay attention to when voting? In the survey, 86 percent indicated that the positions of the party in the European Parliament determined their vote. Several themes for the European elections were discussed in the Ipsos questionnaire. We discuss the most striking results below. For example, the majority of respondents, voters and non-voters, want voters, not that the Netherlands is leaving the European Union. 65 percent disagree with the statement 'The Netherlands must leave the European Union', and 15 percent agree. In 2014, 24 percent still wanted to leave the EU. A nexit was one of the positions of, for example, the Forum for Democracy or PVV parties. The figures from the survey show that voters from those parties in particular are more in favor of a nexit: for example, 44 percent of PVV voters want to leave the EU ( versus remain: 29 percent) and 36 percent of FvD voters (against remain: 31 percent). Only 15 percent of Dutch people indicate that the discussion about Brexit has made them a stronger supporter of a nexit. 60 percent have not become stronger supporters. Another important theme in the research is labor migration within the European Union, and especially whether this migration is good for the Dutch economy. There, the opinions among Dutch people are very close: 29 percent of respondents think that labor migration is good for the Dutch economy, compared to 29 percent who think that labor migration is not good. Another theme these elections was the euro. Is going back in time and reintroducing the guilder an option? Not according to the Dutch people interviewed. At least 62 percent want to keep the euro and not return to the guilder. 18 percent of respondents want to return to the guilder. This was also an important point of the FvD. For example, party leader Thierry Baudet (not eligible today) indicated yesterday in a debate with Rutte that he wanted to \\\"unbundle the euro\\\". According to Baudet, that shouldn't be a problem. Of FvD voters, 39 percent agree with Baudet: the Netherlands should get rid of the euro. However, that is close to the percentage that does not want to leave the euro: 38 percent. The research also looked into the future. What themes should the EU focus on in the coming years? The number one priority is combating terrorism and organized crime (52 percent), followed by protecting the environment and climate (33 percent) and reducing immigration outside the EU (30 percent). Combating poverty and social inequality (28 percent) and combating tax evasion and avoidance by large companies (25 percent) are also important. Metallica supports the Children of the Food Bank foundation. The metal band will perform at the Johan Cruijff Arena in Amsterdam on June 11 and has pledged to donate part of the proceeds from ticket sales to the foundation against child poverty. In every country where Metallica performs, the band donates money to charity, such as food banks and schools. \\\"We were quite surprised when the message came in from America,\\\" Children of the Food Bank told Omroep Gelderland. It is not known how much Metallica is donating. In addition to the donation, food bank employees are also allowed to meet the band members. \\\"We have been invited to a meet and greet with the band and the presentation of a very nice check,\\\" the foundation said. The Food Bank Children's Foundation gives birthday packages to children from poor families, so that they can enjoy treats at school or throw a party. The foundation also provides clothing. Dutch seed breeder Simon Groot is this year's winner of the World Food Prize. This was announced by the US Department of State. Groot wins $250,000. He receives the important food prize for developing seeds for vegetables that are much more resistant to diseases than regular seeds. They also grow faster. Groot developed the seeds with his company East-West Seed. Farmers in Asia in particular benefit from this: they used seeds of moderate to poor quality, which led to poor harvests, poverty and malnutrition. \\u201cAs the seeds were distributed across the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia and across Southeast Asia, farmers' lives were improved and consumers benefited from greater access to nutritious vegetables,\\u201d said Kenneth Quinn of the World Food Prize Foundation. \\u201cGroot has a hugely important global network of seed producers, who change the lives of 20 million farmers every year. He absolutely deserves the award.\\u201d Groot says he is happy with the price. \\\"But the ultimate recognition is for the millions of small farmers who have been able to make agriculture their business. Small-scale vegetable cultivation is a great way to create income and employment in rural areas, and at the same time improve the diet for many people.\\\" The World Food Prize was established in 1986 by Nobel Peace Prize winner Norman Borlaug. He wanted to recognize scientists and others who have committed themselves to the quality and availability of food. Groot will receive the award on October 17, during a ceremony in Des Moines, the capital of the state of Iowa. Couples with a large age difference are more likely to break up. Of couples who are more than ten years apart, more than a third are no longer together after twelve years. With an age difference of less than five years, the chance of this happening is approximately 25 percent, reports the Central Bureau of Statistics. If the partners are five to ten years apart, the chance of a breakup is almost 30 percent. For the study, CBS followed couples who married or started living together in 2003. Hetero relationships with a large age difference have a slightly greater chance of success if the man is older, the research shows. The chance of a breakup is also greater if couples start living together at a young age. If they do this between the ages of 18 and 20, there is a 49 percent chance that they will be separated after twelve years. 20 to 24 year olds have a much lower risk of fracture at 29 percent. Above the age of 25, the chance of divorce is about a quarter for all age groups. The level of education also has a major influence on the chance of a relationship succeeding. If both partners have a college or university degree, the chance of a breakup within twelve years is 19 percent, compared to 31 percent if they are both not highly educated. If one of the partners has a college or university degree, the risk of a rift lies somewhere in between. According to Statistics Netherlands, there are even more factors that influence the duration of relationships. For example, unmarried couples and couples without children divorce more often. A low income, children from previous relationships and different migration backgrounds also increase the risk of a break-up. Sometimes cancer medicines help against more types of cancer than those for which they were developed and registered. However, they are only reimbursed for the treatment of the type of cancer for which they are approved. Patients with other cancer types therefore do not have access to a medicine that they might benefit from. Doctors, pharmaceutical companies, health insurers and the Healthcare Institute have now come up with a solution for this that they will try out in a study with patients. 130 patients from Dutch hospitals with all types of cancer are included in a study. The similarity between them is that their tumors all have the same rare genetic characteristic, namely an MSI profile. This means that the tumor has many errors in its DNA. The patients in the study are treated with the immunotherapy nivolumab. This drug should boost your own immune system. The pharmaceutical company pays for the expensive medicine during this sixteen-week research phase. Health insurers will then pay the costs of the treatment for all patients who show benefit from it after sixteen weeks. Regardless of whether the drug used is officially intended for the cancer they have. The research is part of an ongoing study, the DRUP study. In an earlier phase, a study among 24 patients, two out of three cancer patients with such a rare tumor appeared to respond well to the drug. It did not matter whether it was an MSI tumor in the large or small intestine or, for example, an MSI tumor in the endometrium. MSI profiles occur in all tumor types, but most often in the different types of colon cancer. About 5 percent of all colon cancer patients have an MSI tumor. For all cancer patients, that share is 2 percent. The excellent research result confronted the scientists harshly with the question: what now? Because nivolumab is not registered for the treatment of colon cancer or endometrial cancer, it is not reimbursed for the treatment of these diseases. \\\"That is why we sat down with everyone involved,\\\" says Emile Voest, internist-oncologist and medical director of the Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital in Amsterdam. \\\"To see how we can arrange that patients who appear to benefit from a medicine have access to such a medicine.\\\" In the pilot study, manufacturer Bristol-Myers Squibb pays for the nivolumab. Voest says that we will increasingly have to deal with very small patient groups for whom tailor-made treatment must be sought. \\\"These patient groups are too small to statistically substantiate the effectiveness of a drug, but we do not want to deprive people of a potentially effective drug. With this new approach, the pharmaceutical company pays for the drug for the first four months. After that period we see whether it works. in the patient who receives it. If that is the case, the health insurer will pay for it.\\\" In the meantime, patients continue to participate in the study. \\\"This way we can collect more and more data. You can use it to determine how to proceed. Just like extensive DNA analyzes to better predict for whom the drug will work. We are now going to expand our study with nivolumab with a follow-up study with 130 patients in thirty hospitals. If it gives the same results, we can determine with all parties whether the drug should be reimbursed for more cancer types.\\\" One of the participants is Soraya den Boogert. She has colon cancer and registered just in time for the nivolumab study. After her, no new patients were included in the study. She responded well to the treatment. \\u201cAfter three months my tumors were stable,\\u201d she says. \\\"After six months they had shrunk. Then it stopped again for a while. It happened a bit gradually. They are now so much smaller that two tumors are no longer visible on the scan. It only picks up tumors of half a millimeter. And the third, the largest, has shrunk by half.\\u201d Den Boogert continues to participate in the study. \\\"If my tumors remain stable, I could stop taking nivolumab at the end of the year. But I don't have to. And I don't know if I will do that. I'm a bit afraid of that. Fortunately, I still don't have to do it now.\\\" undecidable.\\\" She now receives nivolumab once a month in the day care department. Furthermore, a scan is made regularly to monitor the development of her tumors. The study with nivolumab is part of a much larger study with more than 400 participating patients in more than thirty hospitals. In this DRUP study (Drug Rediscovery Protocol), 26 existing drugs are tested for their effectiveness against cancers other than those for which they are actually intended. Trials with animal manure, relaxation of animal feed rules and tackling short-term lease contracts. With these measures, Minister Schouten wants to make the transition to 'circular agriculture'. An annual investment of hundreds of millions of euros should help with this. According to the minister, from now on it will be about producing food with as few disadvantages as possible for nature, the environment and climate, she says in the AD. Sustainably grown products will become more expensive, Schouten warns. \\\"Food has become incredibly cheap. We used to spend about 20 percent of our income on it, now it is about 10 to 12 percent.\\\" And that bill is paid by the farmer who has a low income and by nature and the environment, which are burdened more heavily, says Schouten. \\\"Now the risk lies with the farmer. If higher demands are placed on food, including animal welfare, higher compensation is justified.\\\" According to her, supermarkets also have a role in this. She wants agreements on a fairer price for products, and a disputes committee where farmers can go with complaints about demands from buyers. Schouten also wants it to be easier for farmers to negotiate jointly with supermarkets. To further shape circular agriculture, the minister has designated five experimental areas where farmers may temporarily deviate from the applicable rules. These are regions in the Achterhoek, Peel, Twente, Flevoland and Northern Netherlands. In Peel, for example, more animal manure can be spread on the land, which means less fertilizer is needed and the manure surplus decreases. There will not be a total ban on artificial fertilizer, because farmers will then not be able to fertilize their land sufficiently. \\\"But I am now investing money and energy in developing alternatives, so that we can do without fertilizer in the future,\\\" Schouten says in the newspaper. Schouten also wants to ask Brussels for the relaxation of animal feed rules, so that insects and seaweed can be considered as a protein source. \\\"Seaweed cultivation does not require scarce agricultural land.\\\" By tackling short-term lease contracts for agricultural land, the minister wants to make it more attractive for farmers to use their land sustainably. Ten farmers started precision agriculture this year. Research is being conducted into how technology can be used to better fertilize grassland, how weed control can best be tackled and how nests and animals in the grassland can be better protected. Next year this project will be expanded with ten new farms. A turnaround in agriculture is even more urgently needed due to the decision that the Council of State has drawn from Dutch nitrogen policy. As a result, thousands of permits for livestock farmers have been jeopardized. \\\"I want farmers to find new revenue models,\\\" says Schouten, \\\"I will help them with that.\\\" Food prices have risen faster than normal in recent months. In May, food prices rose by 3.8 percent compared to the same month the year before, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics. This has to do with the VAT increase at the beginning of this year. In January, the lowest rate was increased from 6 to 9 percent. Much food falls under that rate and has therefore become more expensive. However, this does not mean that food is exceptionally expensive at the moment. Over the past ten years, the price of food has risen less rapidly than the average price of all goods and services. The widower of Adrienne Cullen, cancer patient and victim of a medical error at the UMC Utrecht, looks back on a meeting with King Willem-Alexander with a special feeling. The Irish man met the king last week during the state visit to Ireland, where Willem-Alexander said he acknowledged that what happened to Cullen was \\\"terrible\\\". \\u201cThat was a brave gesture,\\u201d writes Peter Cluskey in a piece in The Irish Times. The 58-year-old Cullen died as a result of metastatic cervical cancer, which was discovered too late at the UMCU. After the late diagnosis, the woman fought for years against the closedness of the Utrecht hospital. According to Cullen, the hospital treated her as a patient in an impersonal manner. \\u201cThe king described Adrienne as brave, persistent and altruistic, knowing she was terminal,\\u201d Cluskey writes. Willem-Alexander also said that he had said this before to Irish journalists. \\u201cThe king also said: 'What she has done has brought about change, but losing her must be very, very difficult for you'.\\u201d The pair spoke for about five minutes at a reception about personal topics. The widower is convinced that Cullen's case is seen as \\\"completely unacceptable\\\" at the highest levels in the Netherlands. \\\"It is also recognized that the aftermath was handled shamefully.\\\" Cluskey calls the gesture of the Dutch royal family a \\\"welcome bit of bravery\\\". The Health Council wants the HPV vaccination to be included in the National Vaccination Program for boys as well. Girls and boys should receive the vaccination against the virus that causes cervical cancer around the age of nine. In addition, the Health Council advises State Secretary Blokhuis of Health, Welfare and Sport to set up an additional vaccination program for people up to 26 years of age who have not yet been vaccinated. This proposal is intended to increase the HPV vaccination rate. According to the Health Council, the HPV vaccination offers the best protection if it is given as close as possible to the ninth birthday. The age at which the vaccination is given can be lowered from thirteen years to nine years, because it has become clear that the vaccine retains its effectiveness long enough. An infection by the HPV virus (human papillomavirus) can cause not only cervical cancer. HPV infections also contribute to the development of cancer of the anus, penis, vagina, labia and oral cavity. About eight hundred women are diagnosed with cervical cancer every year, while about two hundred women die from the disease every year. According to the Council, the vaccination has few side effects. Research shows that there is no link between the HPV vaccination and chronic fatigue, migraines and autoimmune diseases. There are many stories going around about this. Partly because of this, the uptake of the HPV vaccination has been low since its introduction in 2010. In the first year, 56.5 percent of the 12 and 13-year-old girls called came to get the shot. In the years that followed, turnout rose slightly to 61 percent in 2013 and 2014, before falling sharply to 45.5 percent in 2016, the last year for which data is available. A high vaccination rate is not only important for the people who are vaccinated. Those who do not get vaccinated for whatever reason also benefit from it. The more people are vaccinated, the better the group protection works and the fewer people can transmit the contagious virus. Spread occurs through sexual contact and that is why it is important to also vaccinate boys. No sexually transmitted disease is as common in the world - and in the Netherlands - as HPV infections. HPV infections are not only (partly) responsible for the development of various forms of cancer. The virus can also cause genital warts and laryngeal papillomatosis. The latter is a condition in which small growths (papillomas) grow on the mucous membrane of the airways. The Dutch Association of Pediatricians (NVK), the Dutch Association for Pathology (NVVP) and the KWF Cancer Control endorse the Health Council's advice. All three organizations underscore the importance of expanding vaccination to boys to prevent the spread of the HPV virus and reduce the number of cancers associated with HPV infections. Climate change will lead to a loss of 2.2 percent of hours worked worldwide by as early as 2030. That corresponds to 80 million full-time jobs. This mainly concerns outdoor work, such as construction and agriculture and garbage collection. This is stated in a study by the International Labor Organization ILO. Catherine Saget, one of the report's authors, warns: \\\"On top of huge economic losses, we can expect more inequality and poorer working conditions for the most vulnerable.\\\" Saget also expects migration to increase worldwide due to rising temperatures. At high temperatures people become less productive and it can even be dangerous to work. This is called heat stress. In 1995, the economic loss due to heat stress was estimated at 250 billion euros. According to the ILO, this will be 2100 billion in 2030. The report comes just after the warmest June ever measured in the Netherlands. Germany, Poland and France also set a heat record. In France it was 45.8 degrees, the highest temperature ever measured in France. Yesterday, UN CEO Guterres once again urged action with the message that the last four years have been the warmest ever recorded. The report assumes that the Earth will be 1.5 degrees warmer by the end of the century. The 2015 Paris climate agreement assumes a maximum of 2 degrees. As in a UN report last week, the ILO concludes that the poorest regions will suffer most from the temperature increase. West Africa and South Asia are specifically mentioned. Because lower incomes do not have the means to protect themselves against the heat, they are hit hardest. Catherine Saget expects more migration as people will try to escape the heat. Between 2005 and 2015, more heat stress was already associated with more migration. All sectors will be affected by the higher temperatures, but agriculture will be hit particularly hard. This will lead to higher food prices, which in turn will lead to poverty and food insecurity. The ILO believes that residents are moving from rural areas to cities or other countries. The ILO encourages governments, employers and workers to work together. \\u201cActions from governments, employers and employees to deal with this new reality are urgently needed,\\u201d says Saget. For example, there should be better heat warnings and governments should ensure that labor rules are respected. Employers must also teach their staff how to deal with heat at work. The ILO warns that if more is not done to tackle climate change, the impact of heat stress on work will become much greater. British manufacturer Essential Farma today tripled the price of the drug Priadel, against depression and bipolar mood disorders. While the drug cost 4.76 euros per hundred pills yesterday, this has risen to 15.78 euros since today. This makes a lot of difference among users, mainly people with a bipolar or depressive mood disorder. Due to the price increase, patients will have to pay an annual personal contribution of 80 to 120 euros. That may not seem like much, but users emphasize that the tripling could have enormous consequences. Lonneke Tomas (34) is one of the 19,000 patients who use Priadel. \\u201cLithium, the active ingredient, is so important to me,\\u201d she says. \\\"It gave me my life back,\\\" she says in this video. Tomas struggles with severe manic depression. Although she had been taking medication for this for some time, she fell into a deep valley three years ago. \\\"During that period I couldn't do anything, I felt rejected by everyone. I was also admitted during that time.\\\" The producer states that the aim is for the drug to remain available for the Dutch market. \\u201cAs a small company, we can only do that by ensuring we cover costs.\\u201d Essential Pharma further states that the new price falls within Dutch law. Since she started taking Priadel, things have gotten much better. \\\"I can do things again: walk, go to volunteer work and pick up my sister's children from school without difficulty. None of that was possible before.\\\" The price increase is having a serious impact on Tomas, who lives on Wajong benefits. \\\"A hundred euros a year is a lot for me. My income is not a lot; that hundred euros is the only weekend away a year that I can afford, or the few times I visit friends.\\\" Tomas is not the only Priadel user with a low income. Many people who take the medicine receive benefits because they cannot work due to their illness. So they have to live frugally, while manic depression costs money, says Tomas. \\u201cThat's something a lot of people don't understand,\\u201d she says. \\\"Every year I have to pay my entire deductible. If I have to be picked up by ambulance, if I go through a bad period, that also costs a lot of money.\\\" Priadel is not the first product that Essential Pharma has made more expensive. The pharmaceutical company came under controversy in 2017 due to price increases on various medicines that it had purchased from other manufacturers. One of those medications is Camcolit, another medication for people who are manic depressive. \\u201cI'm afraid they're going to raise prices even more,\\u201d says Tomas. \\\"I'm doing quite well now, but this pharmaceutical company has a monopoly. Suppose the personal contribution had not been nine but eighteen euros per month, then I would not have been able to pay it. Then I would probably have been admitted within a short time.\\\" It is still possible for Tomas to continue with Priadel, but she fears that this does not apply to everyone. This is also because it is tempting to pass up the medicine. \\\"People with bipolar disorder can end up in a manic period without medication. The euphoric feeling you get is addictive. In such a period you lose your self-insight. The price increase can therefore be the push to stop taking the pills. \\\" And that can have disastrous consequences, Tomas warns. \\\"For example, during such a period I get into debt. Then I buy expensive brand shampoo that I cannot afford, instead of the cheaper house brand. Other people have to be picked off the street in confusion.\\\" The price increase is therefore not only a problem for patients, but for society as a whole, she emphasizes. \\\"I tell everyone that, even if I have to travel all over the Netherlands for it.\\\" The Netherlands may be the number one flower country, but a bouquet of roses at the florist rarely comes from our own country. Planes go back and forth to Africa every day to pick up flowers. Roses, but also geraniums and, yes, marigolds. It is less known that they are sometimes grown under harsh conditions. An agreement with the sector should help improve this. \\\"All those planes you see shooting through the sky here, they are not all tourists coming to see the elephants,\\\" says correspondent Koert Lindijer from Nairobi. \\\"They are often also full of flowers.\\\" Rose cultivation has existed in Kenya for decades. As well as the abuses: extremely low wages, dangerous pesticides and poor housing for workers. \\\"It was already written about twenty years ago. Partly because of this, they started using less poison.\\\" The use of scarce water is also a problem. In neighboring Ethiopia, the flower sector has not existed for very long. This has developed rapidly and Dutch gardeners play an important role in this. Frank Ammerlaan of AQ Roses grows roses that travel all over the world via the Netherlands. \\\"Within three days after they leave our greenhouses, they are in stores in the Netherlands,\\\" he says from the town of Ziway in the heart of Ethiopia. Ammerlaan left the Netherlands about fifteen years ago because the costs of cultivation became too high and he could hardly cope with the competition. It was at a time when Ethiopia started bringing in foreign companies to create employment and boost exports. They could get huge tracts of land for little money, did not have to pay taxes in the first few years and did not have to deal with minimum wages and regulations. Lindijer outlines situations where six employees have to sleep in a bed and barely earn enough to eat. That is absolutely not the case at the Ammerlaan rose nursery, he says. His company pays $1.90 a day, slightly more than the absolute poverty line used by the World Bank, and says it will increase wages. \\\"Employees are entitled to free healthcare and can follow training.\\\" The pesticides have also been tackled; the company says it is using more and more biological pesticides. It is usually impossible to tell from a bunch of flowers where they come from and whether they have been grown in an 'honest' manner. Some supermarkets sell flowers with the Fairtrade quality mark, but not all, says Max Havelaar spokesperson Tara Scally. \\\"It's best to just ask in the store. Supermarkets buy their own, so they know where the flowers come from. In flower shops they don't always know. But just asking that question can help raise awareness about this subject. .\\\" There are also entrepreneurs who do not take working conditions very seriously. But these are mainly local growers and companies from Asia, according to Ammerlaan. He is therefore in favor of international agreements, but also welcomes the Dutch agreement. Quality mark organization Max Havelaar/Fairtrade Netherlands recognizes that part of the sector is doing its best to improve working conditions and sustainability. But it's not enough, says spokesperson Tara Scally. Max Havelaar has therefore not signed the agreement. \\\"We would have liked to see steps taken more quickly. Our demands go a lot further on many points. These nurseries have a positive effect on employment, but the local population must be taken into account. We also want them to have trade union representation. that matters such as maternity leave are arranged and that wages rise every year with inflation. And of course, companies are also not allowed to cause damage to the environment.\\\" Grower Frank Ammerlaan also supports this, because good working conditions are also in the interest of the company, the grower believes. \\\"It doesn't benefit us if people don't have enough to eat. We are guests here, so you have to behave like a good guest.\\\" Yet not everyone in Ethiopia is happy with the foreign entrepreneurs. In 2016, there was an uprising against the government, with growers favored by the state quickly becoming the target. Protesters entered nurseries, beat workers and caused destruction. Calm has now returned - although there was a failed coup in one of the states more than a week ago. \\\"The country is emerging from a dictatorship and there are many interests at play,\\\" Ammerlaan puts things into perspective. \\\"That takes a lot of time.\\\" The partner of a deceased employee may receive five annual salaries from the pension fund as a survivor's benefit in the future. The partner can opt for a benefit spread over five years or can use the money for a lifelong benefit. The FNV confirms a report about this from de Volkskrant. At the request of Minister Koolmees of Social Affairs and Employment, trade unions and employers are working on advice about the survivor's pension. This scenario, paying out five annual salaries, is one of the variants that are now on the table. A new plan should replace the current complicated survivor's pension system. It still often happens that after the death of a partner, the surviving relative is faced with a major poverty trap. \\\"And then it is sometimes 60, 70 percent less,\\\" says independent pension expert Joop Rietmulder in the NOS Radio 1 Journaal. At present, the pension transfer is usually well arranged if the deceased was retired. But last year there were almost 120,000 men and women in our country whose partner died before he or she was 65. In those cases, there is often a meager benefit. At the end of the last century, the General Widows and Orphans Act (AWW), a benefit for surviving relatives, was replaced by the much more austere General Surviving Dependents Act (ANW). That's what causes that gap. Rietmulder: \\\"This is, for example, due to the concept of 'partner', which is different in many pension schemes. Sometimes a statement that you have been living together for a long time and have care for children is sufficient, other times this must be recorded at the notary. This sometimes leads to disappointment among people who think they will receive a survivor's pension, but do not comply with the rules.\\\" Furthermore, in the current system, only the last period of service with your last employer counts. This determines the amount of the survivor benefit. \\\"The system used to be that you worked for a boss for 40 years, and your pension was based on that.\\\" This summer, the different variants will be further developed by the trade union movement and employers. The advice to Minister Koolmees is expected early this autumn. Still no one seems to miss the woman who was found on June 22 near Westdorpe, on the border with Belgium. The woman was violently killed and found naked. A garbage bag lay next to her body. She will receive an anonymous funeral in Terneuzen on Tuesday, but the police are doing everything they can to find out her identity. \\\"We want to know who this woman is as quickly as possible, so that we can inform her loved ones,\\\" says prosecutor Kim Weijers. The police large-scale investigation team has checked missing persons files in the Netherlands and Belgium. Her DNA, fingerprints and dental data have also been compared with databases in other European countries and beyond. The police have released images of the murdered woman. The press release about the case can also be consulted in French and English. \\\"We desperately need the public at home and abroad to determine her identity,\\\" says police team leader Martine Jacobs. \\\"Finding out her identity is our most important task. Only then can we investigate whoever is responsible for this.\\\" The police have already received 174 reports, but the golden tip does not seem to be among them yet. That is why the police ask everyone in their area to look out for people who may have been away since June 22. It may be that the woman or the perpetrator has given a reason why she is not yet missed in her environment. For example, her loved ones might think that she is still on holiday or working abroad. According to the police, the woman must have been alive. Her teeth and teeth were in good condition and she had undergone medical treatment in the past for ovaries, uterus, appendix and gallbladder, meaning she sought medical attention when she needed it. Because her identity is not yet known, the woman will receive a nameless grave in Terneuzen and a funeral from the municipality, writes Omroep Zeeland. Avengers, Star Wars, Frozen, Aladdin and The Lion King: Walt Disney owns the largest film titles and studios. The American company has already sold more than $8 billion in movie tickets this year, a record. With a few more big autumn hits, such as Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, in the pipeline, there seems to be no end to Disney's success story anytime soon. According to film expert Rick de Gier, Disney has established itself this year as the media company par excellence. \\\"If you take the films alone - because the company also owns theme parks, for example - then you are already talking about a huge source of income. This year, Disney has already released six films, almost all of which did great. That is almost one big film per month.\\\" According to business magazine Forbes, Disney is now the second largest media company in the world, after Comcast. With the acquisition of Fox completed this year, Disney is growing even further. The question is what that means for the film world. One of this year's big Disney successes is The Lion King, a remake of the 1994 original: \\\"I tend to get a little anxious about any company that becomes so huge,\\\" says De Gier. \\\"Google, Apple, Disney is that kind of company. Whether that's good or bad... well.\\\" According to him, you can look at this in two ways. \\\"The average film viewer doesn't pay much attention to which company is behind a film. In the past, each studio had its own stamp, but nowadays that is no longer the case. I don't think anyone really knows the difference either. People just look at the offer and choose watch a movie and go there.\\\" But the other production companies will find it more difficult to swallow the success of their major competitor. \\\"They are well behind Disney, but they will do better to reduce that gap. I expect that competition will stimulate creativity. They will look hard for good scriptwriters and directors and they can certainly be found in Hollywood,\\\" said De Gier. Disney's main opposition is Warner Bros. (Harry Potter, DC Comics films such as Batman and Wonder Woman), Sony (Spider-Man, James Bond), Universal (Jurassic World, Fast & Furious) and Paramount (Transformers, Mission: Impossible). But those production companies don't come close to Disney's total revenue. That creativity is precisely what the other producers will have to excel with, because Disney seems to have found a trick that works very well time and time again: releasing remakes of old films. And that gives mixed feelings, says Jorn Jokker of D-log, a Dutch-language fansite. \\\"That is their business: focusing on purchasing existing titles and then developing them further. Ultimately, you run the risk of just milking them to the limit.\\\" Disney has even experienced this with Solo, a spin-off of Star Wars that was released six months after The Last Jedi. It was not rated very well by critics and Star Wars fans were not crazy about it either. \\\"Then you get a full feeling and that is a pitfall that Disney must watch out for in the future,\\\" Jokker warns. According to him, creativity could suffer as a result. \\\"The danger I see is that they will soon abandon original ideas or that they will be drowned out in terms of marketing by the success of the remakes. Many films they release have already been successful. They do not want to take many risks with new titles, because they know that They just rake in tons of money this way.\\\" Film expert De Gier goes even further and even calls it poverty of ideas. Yet there is also another good explanation why Disney releases so many remakes. At the end of this year it will launch its own streaming service in the US and of course it will have to be filled. \\\"Disney+ mainly wants to position itself as a platform for family films,\\\" De Gier explains. \\\"And you need an enormous amount of films for that. It is cheap and fast to use those remakes for that. By incorporating the Fox licenses, they are now also working on, among other things, a new Home Alone film \\\"The battle between Netflix and Disney+ will be the great war of the coming years.\\\" In addition, it is a smart way to introduce children to the classic cartoons. \\\"The YouTube generation is no longer interested in those old films,\\\" says Disney fan Jokker. \\\"For parents, these remakes are nostalgic. They are curious about what Disney has made of it and they take their children along to introduce them to those old classics.\\\" And it turns out that older visitors still enjoy it too. De Gier: \\\"When I heard that they were going to remake cartoons, I was sceptical, but now I look at it differently. Jungle Book and Beauty and the Beast were very successful and added a lot. So yes, I want to be cynical, But actually I secretly think they're nice films.\\\" More Dutch people use the food bank. This is evident from a six-monthly survey among food banks. People who use the food bank receive food with an average value of around 43 euros every week. In the first half of 2019, approximately 35,500 households used the food bank. That is 8 percent more than in the same period last year. The number of children who received help increased by almost 7 percent. More singles, single-parent families and the elderly were also helped. This is believed to be because the costs of living have risen faster than pensions and state pensions. The number of people using food aid also increased last year. According to Food Banks Netherlands, this was mainly due to relaxed admission standards. The Association of Food Banks notes major differences at regional and local level between food banks. Not all locations manage to collect good food. This could be due to a shortage of volunteers. Some food banks are also located in areas where there are few supermarkets. The food bank in Leeuwarden made an 'emergency call' via Facebook at the beginning of August because the warehouse had become empty. Thanks to volunteers, the shelves have now been filled again, the Leeuwarden food bank said. An action by the supporters' association of football club ADO is a great success. The club collects cuddly toys for sick children at the Sophia Children's Hospital and has now received more than 20,000 cuddly animals. On September 15, ADO will play against Feyenoord in De Kuip under the watchful eye of patients from the children's hospital in Rotterdam. To give the children an extra fun day, the ADO fans decided to collect cuddly toys to spread them over the section with the sick children. This is the second time that ADO has showered patients with cuddly toys. In 2016, supporters threw hundreds of plush animals into the children's section, which resulted in beautiful images. Watch images of ADO's cuddly toy campaign in 2016 here: This time it is not about hundreds but about thousands of cuddly toys. \\\"It has gotten somewhat out of hand,\\\" Jacco van Leeuwen told Omroep West. The chairman of the supporters' association is proud of the action. The only problem is that not all of the cuddly toys are allowed into the stadium. About 3,000 to 4,000 cuddly toys can be spread above the section with patients. \\\"Otherwise you're still throwing ten minutes after the game. Then it really becomes a mess,\\\" says Van Leeuwen. As a solution to the cuddly toy surplus, various ADO supporter groups have set up an extra promotion where people can adopt a cuddly animal for 1 euro. The proceeds go to the Sophia Children's Hospital. Cuddly toys are also given to other children's charities. \\\"We have already supplied to hospices, a disabled institution, Sinterklaas organizations, the food bank. In fact, all kinds of institutions where you can still make children happy with a hug,\\\" says Van Leeuwen. ADO is not the only football club that has collected cuddly toys for the annual match to which Feyenoord invites sick children. For example, last year Excelsior supporters distributed plush animals. A steak or two kilos of green beans for 25 cents? As of today, consumers can buy fresh products for that amount in some branches of the supermarket chain Lidl. At least: when the expiry date of those products has arrived. With the trial, which started today in twenty branches in the Gooi and the Amersfoort region, Lidl hopes to combat food waste. The first results are \\\"overwhelming\\\", says a spokesperson for the supermarket chain. \\\"Many fresh products were quickly sold out this morning.\\\" Lidl is not afraid that customers will wait to buy a loaf of bread, piece of meat or fruit and vegetable box until it is on the shelves for 25 cents. \\\"Of course we can never rule that out, but customers initially just come to do their shopping. And then they see this initiative.\\\" Lidl is not alone in its fight against food waste. Not by a long shot, in fact. In May, Albert Heijn in Zandvoort started a trial with 'dynamic discounting', whereby products became cheaper as the expiry date approached. Many supermarkets are also affiliated with the 'Too Good To Go' app. Jumbo, AH, Marqt, Ekoplaza and more and more Plus stores offer boxes of unsold products at a reduced rate via that app. \\\"There is no supermarket that is not seriously working on this subject,\\\" says Toine Timmermans of Wageningen University. Timmermans has been talking to supermarkets for ten years about ways to combat food waste. \\\"Then they said: interesting, but we won't do it. Now it is: doing nothing is not an option. There is much more attention to it, also socially.\\\" Timmermans is director of the Together Against Food Waste foundation, in which Wageningen University, the Nutrition Center and several supermarkets work together. \\\"The 25-cent promotion from Lidl, the dynamic discounts from AH: they all seem like separate initiatives. But that is absolutely not the case. We advise supermarkets that are affiliated with our foundation on what they can do to minimize food consumption. to waste. But ultimately they choose what they do.\\\" Supermarkets that are affiliated with the Together Against Food Waste foundation want to waste half as much food in 2030 as in 2015. These include Albert Heijn, Jumbo, and Lidl. Supermarket chain Aldi also has that objective. In addition to supermarkets, companies are also affiliated with the foundation, including McDonald's and Rabobank. In this way, according to Timmermans, a \\\"very nice competition\\\" is emerging between supermarkets. \\\"What Lidl is doing now is a new way that I think is very effective. It also fits very well with a discounter like Lidl, a supermarket like AH would not do this so quickly. Supermarkets choose measures that suit their formula.\\\" Some restaurants are also engaged in a battle against food waste. Earlier we took a look at the Instock restaurant. They have been cooking for years with food that would otherwise be thrown away. You can see what tips they have to combat food waste in this video: But what does it ultimately yield? The well-known Dutch supermarkets waste about 180,000 tons of food per year, says Timmermans. A pittance, compared to the total of 1.7 to 2.5 million tons of wasted food in the Netherlands. \\\"The next step, and at the same time the biggest challenge, is to provide consumers with better information. And to combat waste earlier in the food chain.\\\" It is also not the intention that consumers will soon be saddled with the supermarket waste problem. \\\"For example, if someone buys a huge box of vegetables for 25 cents, he should not be left at home with them. Lidl must then make it clear what customers can do with those vegetables, such as freezing them. But they are already working on that. \\\" Other supermarkets also provide information, says Henrieke Crielaard of trade organization CBL. \\\"For example, they inform consumers about how they can best store and prepare fresh products.\\\" For example, Jumbo states portion sizes on some packaging. And Plus gives consumers tips on, for example, cooking with leftovers. \\\"Consumers are another link, but an important one.\\\" Many supermarkets donate products they have left over to the food bank. Every week, food banks in the Netherlands distribute around 850,000 products to customers, which is more than 44 million per year. The food bank is not afraid that it will receive fewer products due to initiatives such as those of Lidl. Also because, for example, the 25-cent promotion can also be interesting for their own customers, says a spokesperson. People who opt for the 'free' marriage still have to pay in five municipalities. This is what the website ThePerfectWedding.nl concludes after research. According to the site, couples who get married in Duiven pay 97.65 euros in administration costs. In Bergen op Zoom, Halderberge, Duiven, Gorinchem and Westervoort, couples pay between 55.50 and 97.65 euros for mandatory administrative actions or for the banns. When asked, Duiven and Westervoort say that this concerns \\\"administration costs for preparing the deed, arranging the wedding officiant, reserving the space, etc..\\\" The municipalities say that they have now discovered that they have misinterpreted the rules. In addition, research by the wedding website, which requested information from all 355 municipalities, shows that 48 percent of municipalities exclude residents from other municipalities from the free wedding. Some municipalities only offer free weddings to low-income residents. The income with which you can claim a free marriage differs per municipality. For example, couples in Reusel-De Mierden may earn a maximum of 120 percent of the social assistance standard, while in Oirschot the social assistance standard is the maximum joint income. A frequently heard complaint is that couples have to wait a long time for the free wedding, says Lodewijk de Groot of The Perfect Wedding. \\\"Suppose you are ill and want to get married as soon as possible, then you are forced to choose a paid option,\\\" he says. By putting a price on free marriage, exclusion of people from outside the municipalities and an income test, According to De Groot, municipalities make it unattractive to get married for free. This is not legally permitted at all, he says. According to the law, municipalities are not allowed to exclude bridal couples from a free wedding ceremony. In addition, municipalities with more than 10,000 inhabitants are obliged to have two moments per week reservation for a wedding without costs. Anyone who gets married for free at the municipality of Halderberg pays 59 euros. The municipality charges these costs for 'processing the documents', spokesperson Teuntje Stoopen explains. \\\"There are employees who have to process pieces,\\\" she says. The 59 euros is indeed not free, but it is considerably cheaper than getting married on the weekend or on other weekdays, Stoopen notes. That costs 930 and 428 euros respectively. The average waiting time for a free wedding ceremony in the Netherlands is 79 days. But in cities such as Haarlem, Eindhoven and Utrecht it is nine months. Residents of the municipality of Haarlem have to wait the longest to say yes for free: 285 days. Poverty in the Netherlands continues to decline, reports the Social and Cultural Planning Office. The number of poor people has decreased from more than 1.2 million in 2013 to 939,000 in 2017. This means that 5.3 percent of the Dutch population is poor. Poverty is decreasing because the economy is growing and more people have work. Proportionally, poverty is most common among children, people over the age of 90 and people with a migration background. Nearly half of poor adults have a migration background. To measure poverty, the planning agency uses a so-called 'not much but sufficient budget'. That amount includes money for clothing, public transport, laundry and cleaning products, an internet connection and mobile phone. Poverty is rare among people over 65: only 3 percent of them are poor. But poverty is much higher among people over 90. Of all elderly people over the age of 90, 11 percent are poor; a total of 12,000 people. \\\"This is partly because they have higher healthcare costs and have to use aids that are not reimbursed,\\\" says Hagar Roijackers of the KBO-PCOB elderly organization. \\\"We see that this group no longer goes to the dentist or physiotherapist.\\\" Many people over the age of 90 have been able to accrue less pension during their working lives than younger retirees. Poverty is much lower among people over 90 who own a home. According to the SCP, 8.1 percent of children up to 12 years old live in poverty. This concerns a total of 272,000 children. According to the SCP criteria, there is a limited group of working poor. In 2017 this was 220,000. A third of all poor adults are in work. Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague have the highest percentages of poor people. In the three major cities, more than 10 percent are poor. That is considerably less than in 2013, when about 15 percent were poor. Poverty has declined among all groups since 2013, except among Syrians. This is because many Syrians have come to the Netherlands since 2015. More than half of Syrians are poor. It is also possible to use other definitions of poverty. A stricter criterion is whether people can meet basic needs. If this criterion is used, there are more than 600,000 poor people in the Netherlands. This is the figure that CBS uses in its report on prosperity in the Netherlands. Partly because of this, CBS has been painting a slightly different picture than the SCP for years. Last week, CBS reported that the poor and especially people with persistent debts have less and less to spend. It was also announced that more people are going to the food bank. The number of poor people as measured by the SCP is therefore declining, but this does not rule out that problems will increase within the group of poor people who remain. Good morning! Today the trial against PVV leader Geert Wilders continues and British Prince Harry comes to Amsterdam. Today it will be partly cloudy and a few showers may fall, especially in the northeast. The temperature rises to 19 to 22 degrees. Are you going out? Here you will find an overview of the work, traffic jams and the situation on the track. The Netherlands has fewer people living in poverty again. In 2017 this was almost 939,000 people, compared to almost 1 million people a year earlier. This decrease can be explained by economic growth and increased employment, says the Social and Cultural Planning Office (SCP). Poverty has been declining since 2013 and this can be seen in almost all population groups. Only among Syrians has poverty risen sharply in recent years. According to the SCP, this may have to do with the composition of the group of refugees who have come to the Netherlands since 2015. In the beginning, this group is still processing war experiences. As a result, they are \\\"relatively often dependent on social assistance\\\". Yesterday's Footballer of the Year gala had to make do without Ajax coach Erik ten Hag. The trainer did not feel like \\\"having fun\\\" with journalists from De Telegraaf. Despite winning the double and almost reaching the Champions League final, Ten Hag receives a lot of criticism from the newspaper. The trainer would not be Amsterdam enough. \\\"It is and remains a blunt, stubborn farmer if you want to see that,\\\" says FOX Sports commentator Leo Driessen in the Sports Forum. \\\"It is tempting to always start talking about that. There is plenty to note, but not to criticize. I find De Telegraaf's criticism reprehensible.\\\" \\\"Ajax's last season under Ten Hag was so good that it becomes unbelievable if you are extremely critical of him,\\\" says NOS football commentator Frank Wielaard. The NOS Football Podcast #59 can be listened to here and can also be downloaded via iTunes. Nice day! Fewer and fewer Dutch people are living in poverty, according to the most recent figures from the Social Cultural Planning Office (SCP). So good news. Yet the report raises many questions. The picture that is painted seems to be at odds with previous reports, say some readers. For example, at the end of August it was announced that more and more people are going to the food bank. In the same week it also became apparent that more and more people, especially young people, ended up on the streets. This makes it seem as if poverty is only increasing. What's up with that? The number of people using food aid has been increasing for several years. In the first half of 2019, approximately 35,500 households went to the food bank, 8 percent more than in the same period last year. And a year earlier there was an increase of 6 percent people. According to food banks in the Netherlands, this was mainly due to previously relaxed admission standards. By lowering that limit, potential customers will find their way to the food bank more quickly. There is something else at play, the organization says. The cost of living has risen faster than pensions and the state pension, which has also helped more singles, single-parent families and the elderly. And that corresponds with the SCP report. It can be read that although poverty is declining in general, children in particular are at a higher risk of poverty compared to, for example, adults, which may be because they live in a single-parent family with a lower income. Then there is a difference between when you are poor according to the Food Bank and eligible for help, and when you are poor according to the SCP. To measure poverty, the planning agency assumes a 'not much but sufficient budget'. That amount includes money for clothing, public transport, laundry and cleaning products, an internet connection and mobile phone. For a single person, this amounts to 1,135 euros per month in 2017. The Food Bank uses a different limit: if you, as a single person, have less than 225 euros left over for food and clothing per month, you are eligible for help. There are a total of 35,500 customers of the Food Bank, much less than the number of people that the SCP now labels as poor: 939,000 people. \\\"That food bank also includes people who are not poor according to our poverty line. But because of a different definition of poverty, this can simply go together,\\\" says SCP researcher Stella Hoff about the differences. SCP researcher Stella Hoff understands the confusion about the results of the report on poverty and the experience that some people have themselves or read in the media. \\\"For a number of years now, after this publication, we have been receiving calls from angry citizens who do not recognize what we are saying at all. I understand that if, for example, you are not improving at an individual level, due to higher living costs and an insufficient increase in income. But The figures do show that poverty is decreasing. Then it is not true for them personally, but it is true for the Netherlands as a whole.\\\" The number of homeless people has also increased in recent years, figures from the Central Bureau of Statistics previously showed. A major problem, say aid organizations, which they believe is mainly due to the lack of suitable housing. Relatively many young people end up on the street: one in three homeless people is between 18 and 30 years old. Statistics Netherlands reported at the end of last year that many homeless people already belonged to the households with the lowest incomes in the years before they ended up on the street. But being poor and becoming homeless do not always have to go together, says SCP researcher Hoff. \\\"Due to a divorce you sometimes have to leave your home and sometimes you are actually homeless. So in that sense it cannot be compared one to one.\\\" The premium for basic insurance for healthcare costs will be approximately three euros per month higher next year. Sources confirm that the government has reached that expectation. The figures were actually only going to be released on Budget Day, but have now been leaked. The estimated monthly amount is therefore 118 euros. This is emphatically an expectation, based on the costs incurred in healthcare, and a guideline for health insurers. They determine the final premiums in November. These are usually lower than the government guideline. Health insurers can use their reserves to make attractive offers to customers. Insured people now pay an average of 1,384 euros per year for basic insurance, which is mandatory for everyone. In 2020, that will be 1,421 euros, the Ministry of Health expects. That is 37 euros more per year. That amount is relatively small, compared to an earlier calculation by the Central Planning Bureau (CPB). That amounted to a monthly amount of about 121.50 euros. People with a low income are compensated for the premium increase through a higher healthcare allowance. The deductible remains the same: it will remain 385 euros per year during this cabinet period. The number of patients with sickle cell disease in the Netherlands is increasing. Yet little is known about it and in many cases the symptoms are not recognized. It is an example of a disease that mainly affects black and colored people. More attention should be paid to these types of diseases, argues Bart Biemond, professor of Internal Medicine at the Amsterdam UMC, in his inaugural lecture today. Biemond specializes in the treatment of patients with sickle cell disease and thalassemia. These are hereditary forms of anemia in which a disturbance occurs in the formation of hemoglobin in the blood. Hemoglobin is a protein that transports oxygen throughout the body. In sickle cell disease, red blood cells develop into sickle-shaped, stiff cells that can block the bloodstream. To date, little research has been done on these diseases. In his inaugural lecture, Biemond refers to an American study that appeared in the journal Blood in 2013. This shows that there is more than eleven times more money available per patient for research into cystic fibrosis than for research into sickle cell disease. In both cases, these are hereditary diseases that cause serious complications at a young age and greatly reduce life expectancy. In particular, raising money from the public appears to be much easier for research into cystic fibrosis. \\\"The only difference between the two diseases,\\\" says Biemond, \\\"is the background of the patients who suffer from these diseases. Sickle cell disease only affects the black population of the US while cystic fibrosis only occurs in the white population of the US.\\\" \\\"It is strange that so little research is done into a disease like sickle cell disease,\\\" says Biemond. \\\"There are thirty million people worldwide who suffer from it, while there is at most 150 million euros for research. That is really a fraction of the money that comparable other diseases receive.\\\" He knew that forty million people have HIV. \\\"About 35 billion is available for that. I think that difference can be explained by the visibility of the patients. The attention for HIV became enormous when the victims were given a voice. The group suffering from sickle cell disease is much less visible. They really need an ambassador.'' For Biemond, sickle cell disease and thalassemia have had a face for many years. ''I was born and raised in Amsterdam and also completed my education in this city. This brought me into contact with patients from all kinds of backgrounds. And so the people who suffer from sickle cell disease, for example, also got a face for me.'' The consequences of sickle cell disease are disastrous, according to Biemond. \\\"The formation of sickle cells leads to occlusions of the smallest blood vessels in the body. When this happens on a large scale, it is accompanied by very serious pain complaints, especially in the bones. The vascular occlusions that cause these pain attacks can be provoked by cold, infections, surgical interventions or stress.\\\" Rasjid van Engel was not lucky. He has both sickle cell disease and thalassemia. \\u201cA present from my Surinamese parents,\\u201d he jokes. There is little to laugh about his illnesses. Rashid has the pain attacks so characteristic of sickle cell disease. \\\"These are intense pains that are triggered by various causes,\\\" he says. \\\"Only with strong painkillers is the pain somewhat bearable. Such an attack can last a few days, but sometimes also several weeks.\\\" Rashid tries to control his pain attacks at home with codeine and morphine. If that does not help enough, he must be admitted to receive more severe pain relief through the IV. \\\"I was recently in the hospital.\\\" Rasjid fully supports Biemond, who is his doctor, in his quest for more money, attention and research for diseases that mainly affect black and colored people. \\u201cThat's why I set up a foundation to raise funds,\\u201d he says. \\\"Patients describe it as unbearable pain that feels like pins are being hammered into your bones,\\\" Biemond says in his inaugural lecture. \\\"The severity of such attacks becomes most insightful to me from the fact that female sickle cell patients who have experienced childbirth indicate that the pain of a sickle cell crisis, as an attack is called, is many times more intense than that of childbirth. The pain can often can only be controlled with intensive pain medication such as morphine or fentanyl. The symptoms of thalassemia vary from mild complaints to very serious ones such as liver or heart failure. Both diseases are incurable. According to Biemond, there are approximately 300 million carriers of sickle cell disease and thirty million patients worldwide. They mainly live in those parts of the world where malaria is common or occurred: Central and West Africa, India, and the Middle East extending to Turkey and Greece. In some countries (such as Nigeria, Congo and Ghana) it is even more than a quarter of the inhabitants are carriers of the disease. Due to the slave trade from those countries, the disease has spread throughout the Caribbean and the American continent and through migration the disease now occurs in a large part of the world. Sickle cell disease occurs in areas where malaria is or was prevalent, because being a carrier of sickle cell disease offers natural protection against a serious form of malaria that kills many children. But patients with sickle cell disease are extra susceptible to malaria. Ten years after the biggest economic crisis since the 1930s, most people have recovered. They are satisfied with their lives. But that does not apply to a group of around 400,000 people, notes the Social and Cultural Planning Office in The Social State of the Netherlands. This group is unable to catch on. Once every two years, the SCP reviews the well-being of the Dutch for a longer period. This time it concerns the period 2008-2018, during which the economic crisis falls. Because the motto of the coalition agreement is 'everyone in the Netherlands should notice that things are improving', the SCP has investigated whether this is the case. To this end, various themes were examined that affect every Dutch person. A brief look back at those ten years shows that quite a bit happened during that period. We were faced with a credit crisis, a debt crisis and a refugee crisis. But the government also made a number of important system changes. This happened, for example, in social security. Instead of income protection, the focus was on reintegration. Municipalities had to request compensation from people on social assistance benefits. The decentralization in healthcare, work participation and youth care also affected many people. The low point of the economic crisis was in 2013, when purchasing power had fallen for four years in a row. From that moment on, the Dutch economy started a recovery and between 2013 and 2017 purchasing power increased by 8 percent. In 2013, the highest poverty rate of the century was reached. While purchasing power has increased for a large part of the population after 2013, according to the SCP it appears that income inequality has increased slightly. Since 2019, uncertainty about the financial future has been felt more widely in the population. The SCP calls this remarkable because the economy is actually growing further. It is suspected that this has to do with Brexit and the global economy. But it could also be due to rising costs (climate policy and the recent VAT increase) and uncertainty about wages and pensions. The Netherlands has continued to age in the past ten years. The number of people over 65 in relation to the population aged 15 to 64 has increased from 22 percent to 29 percent. More and more elderly people continue to live at home. The share of people over 75 who do not live at home but in an institution has fallen from 10.1 percent to 7.8 percent. The number of young people living at home longer has increased to 7.6 percent in 2018. The native Dutch population has started a modest decline. The population is still growing, due to a birth and migration surplus among migrants. Since 2016, women have overtaken men in educational attainment and the trend is only increasing. The level of education is also increasing among Dutch people with a migration background, but they have not yet caught up. The educational level of migrants from Morocco and Turkey and their descendants in particular is lagging behind. The decline in the share of low-educated people appears to be stagnating among Moroccan and Turkish Dutch people, but the number of highly educated people in these groups is increasing. This is at the expense of the number of people with secondary education. The labor market has become more flexible. After the crisis, the number of self-employed people rose sharply, but this has now leveled off. The number of employees is actually increasing. The number of people with a flexible contract is increasing. According to the SCP, the future employee must have social and empathetic skills. Fairly simple routine work will disappear due to, among other things, robotization. But not everyone will be able to achieve this self-reliance, the SCP warns. This could lead to a growing group of citizens who cannot keep up, resulting in higher unemployment and lower wages among this group. The picture of healthcare is much less favorable than in the previous edition of The Social State of the Netherlands. Then there was talk about the health gains that had been achieved in the period between 1990 and 2015. Life expectancy had increased during that period. More people grew older in a healthier way. But that has now come to an end, at least temporarily. Life expectancy growth has slowed; there was even a decline in life expectancy between 2014 and 2015. This is also the case in many other European countries. In the Netherlands this is probably due to the flu. In the United Kingdom it is linked to cuts in healthcare and welfare. The decline in crime, which has been observed since the turn of the century, continues. Over the past five years, all crime types decreased, except reported cybercrime. Violence did not decrease any less. The SCP has examined whether fewer people have reported crime, resulting in a decrease in crime figures. But no evidence of this has been found. A majority of Dutch people still think that crime has increased recently and is a major problem, but this group has shrunk significantly in recent decades. More money must be invested quickly in protecting countries against extreme weather caused by climate change. Otherwise, costs will rise rapidly from now on and more than a hundred million people could fall below the poverty line by 2030. That is the conclusion of a report by the Global Commission on Adaptation, a global organization that has been based in the Netherlands since last year. The report states that there are increasing numbers of victims worldwide as a result of extreme weather, such as heat, drought and flooding. In addition, the annual damage caused by floods is 66 billion euros. It is therefore important, according to the committee, that more is invested in an environment and infrastructure that is better prepared for weather extremes. Every euro invested in dike reinforcement, for example, leads to a saving of between 2 and 10 euros, because less damage is caused by flooding. According to the committee, more than 1,600 billion euros (1.6 trillion) must be invested in 'climate robustness' worldwide by 2030. This results in an estimated 6.3 trillion euros in savings. \\\"The most important conclusion of this report is that you see that a huge amount of investment is needed worldwide to prevent larger disasters with much higher costs,\\\" says Minister Cora van Nieuwenhuizen of Infrastructure and Water Management. Van Nieuwenhuizen is the initiator of the Global Commission, the international committee for 'adaptation', or adaptation to the changing climate. The committee includes Ban Ki-moon, former Secretary General of the UN, Bill Gates and Kristalina Georgieva of the World Bank. It is important, says Van Nieuwenhuizen, that countries not only tackle their greenhouse gas emissions, but also prepare better for the changes that will occur anyway. \\\"It is not either-or, but and-and. Because the extreme showers that were predicted for 2050 are already falling. So we are already experiencing flooding and drought that we have to tackle, and that applies to the entire world,\\\" said Van Nieuwenhuizen. Not only can other countries learn a lot from the Netherlands when it comes to water management, our country can also use some tips. \\\"We must learn from other countries to deal with drought, to retain water. We have had another dry summer. You must therefore ensure that the infrastructure is robust enough. Not only to withstand flooding, but also drought. We have experienced that a bridge could no longer open and close properly because parts expanded due to the heat. So we can also learn from other countries.\\\" It was also announced today that a global climate summit will be held in Amsterdam next year. \\\"On October 22, 2020, we will gather between 500 and 1,000 world leaders and experts from around the world and we want to show practical examples.\\\" \\\"We are going to inventory all kinds of projects worldwide on how you can adapt to the climate and what is needed for this. And we want to make that knowledge and expertise available to the whole world.\\\" Influential photographer and filmmaker Robert Frank has died at the age of 94. With his masterpiece The Americans, Frank set in motion a photographic revolution in 1958. In 84 photos of factory workers, grave crosses in Nebraska and black and white people on the bus in New Orleans, he showed the raw reality. He showed the downside of The American Dream that many Americans preferred not to see: racial segregation, poverty, consumerism. Frank was born the son of German Jews in Zurich, Switzerland. After the war he went to the US where he traveled through the country for nine months on a grant. He got to know the US through the eyes of his Leica camera. His photos initially received a lot of criticism due to the different framing and lighting, but the book The Americans developed into a cult hit worldwide. After he stopped photography, Frank became a filmmaker. Together with Beat Generation writers Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, he made Pull My Daisy (1959). In the documentary Cocksucker Blues (1972) he followed the American tour of The Rolling Stones. Frank directed a total of 25 films. His style inspired many image makers. According to The New York Times, Frank died on Monday in his Canadian hometown of Inverness, Nova Scotia. He had lived on Canada's east coast since the 1970s. Cramped secrecy, a livestream broadcast simultaneously in 1,300 cinemas and an extensive tour. Scenes reminiscent of the release of a new iPhone or long-awaited blockbuster, but this time it is a book for which all marketing tricks are pulled out. Today, celebrated Canadian writer Margaret Atwood launches her new book The Testaments. It is a sequel to the classic The Handmaid's Tale, which was published in the Netherlands as The Story of the Handmaid. In it, Atwood creates a dystopian world in which humanity has become largely sterile. After a power grab, part of the United States has turned into the Republic of Gilead, where a totalitarian regime of Christian fundamentalist men holds sway. The main character Offred, who is named after her 'owner' Fred, has only one job: to bear children. Offred and other handmaids are ceremonially raped monthly, during ovulation. The children they bear are taken from them. The Handmaid's Tale was the best-selling book on Amazon in 2017, 32 years after it was published. This is not only due to the start of the series of the same name, which introduced millions of people to Offred's oppressive life while binge-watching. \\\"The fact that the book is selling so incredibly well also has to do with America under Trump,\\\" says literary scholar Kristine Steenbergh. \\u201cHis presidency has made the content more current than ever.\\u201d Trump's victory also led to The Testaments now being released. Atwood initially did not want to write a sequel, but since Trump came to power she received so many questions and responses that she finally picked up the pen. Although the book was leaked last week due to an error on Amazon's part, little is known about its contents. Lidwien Biekmann and Tjadine Stheeman translated the Dutch version. \\\"The only thing the media knows so far is that Offred herself does not speak. You also get to know Aunt Lydia better, one of the most cruel characters from the earlier book,\\\" they say in the NOS radio program Met the Eye on Tomorrow. Reviewer Mojdeh Feili was also allowed to read the book, albeit after signing a strict confidentiality statement. \\u201cIt reads like a charm,\\u201d she says. \\\"But I'm not allowed to say more about it.\\\" The Handmaid's Tale was well received in 1985, but has only become incredibly popular in recent years. All over the world, women appear at demonstrations for liberal abortion legislation in blood-red dresses and stark white hoods, the iconic costume that Atwood gave her handmaids. The most cited protest sign in recent times? One with the text Make Margaret Atwood Fiction Again. Spotted at a protest march in Washington. The dystopian novel thus takes on a new meaning for a new generation of readers. And for a new group of feminists, activists and other advocates of women's rights. \\\"My generation reads this and realizes that acquired women's rights should not be taken for granted,\\\" says 30-year-old Feili. \\\"Atwood has made it very real that all those rights can just be taken away from you.\\\" Feili has always called herself a feminist. \\\"But since I read The Handmaid's Tale, I realize that you have to actively fight against conservative ideas.\\\" She has therefore joined the feminist platform De Bovengrondse and is helping with a project for 'abortion buddies'. \\\"These are volunteers who accompany people who visit an abortion clinic,\\\" she explains. People who want to have their pregnancies terminated at Dutch abortion clinics have been harassed by anti-abortion demonstrators since this year. \\\"I find it very intense that abortion buddies are now necessary.\\\" For publicist Hasna El Maroudi (34), the book is about women's rights. \\u201cTen years ago we thought we had acquired all the rights that could be acquired,\\u201d she says. \\\"But now the question of who owns your uterus is super topical again.\\\" She points not only to America, where more and more conservative states are restricting the right to abortion, but also to Europe. For example, the government in Poland only wants to make abortion possible if the life of a pregnant woman is in danger or if she has been raped. \\\"And in Hungary last week there was talk about declining population figures in Eastern Europe.\\\" Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\\u00e1n reiterated his position that Hungarian women should have more children to prevent 'the white European' from disappearing. El Maroudi sees the same thing happening in the Netherlands. \\\"The demonstrators at abortion clinics, but also the comments that FvD leader Thierry Baudet made about women.\\\" Enough reasons for El Maroudi to co-found the feminist media platform Lilith. \\\"These all seem like small interventions, but you are depriving women of the right to control their own bodies.\\\" \\\"Atwood herself says that she would rather not be given the label of feminism if it means that women are portrayed as innocent angels,\\\" says literary scholar Steenbergh. \\\"For example, she is critical of the #MeToo movement because men could not always defend themselves against accusations.\\\" Margaret Atwood is therefore a reluctant feminist icon. Hundreds of elderly people on the Caribbean islands of Bonaire, Saba and St. Eustatius regularly have to go to bed on an empty stomach. They have no food at home and there is often no room at day care, where there is food. The National Ombudsman, Reinier van Zutphen, is sounding the alarm with the publication yesterday in Kralendijk (Bonaire) of his report Eye for the elderly in the Caribbean Netherlands. Older people in the Caribbean Netherlands often lead an inhumane existence, writes Van Zutphen. \\\"They have an AOV benefit (a variant of the Dutch AOW benefit) but can hardly make ends meet and often live in abject poverty.\\\" The costs of basic necessities in the Caribbean Netherlands are often almost twice as high as in the European Netherlands, while an AOV benefit is 450 euros lower for single elderly people. Housing costs are high and groceries expensive. Fresh fruit and vegetables are unaffordable for many elderly people. Nina den Heyer is pleased with the ombudsman's report. She is a representative for Society and Care in the local island government of Bonaire. \\\"A major problem for the elderly is that they cannot do extra work to increase their income. We call it Lora man here, hustling and arranging. Almost everyone has an extra job in addition to work or arranges other matters, because they do not earn enough to to make ends meet. The elderly can no longer do that.\\\" In addition, the facilities on the island are inadequate. \\\"Public transport is poor, the elderly do not go out. They usually live with one of their children or children live with them. Yet they are lonely, because everyone is busy making money, away from home.\\\" The poverty problem among the elderly can be solved, but the Netherlands must tackle the problem seriously, says Deputy Den Heyer. \\\"The group is 2,500 people, how difficult can it be to raise the AOV to an acceptable and already calculated level. Companies should offer a mandatory pension provision for their staff,\\\" she says. Den Heyer agrees with the ombudsman's recommendations. He wants the Netherlands to start today: \\\"We have to work with our hearts,\\\" says Van Zutphen. \\\"The sad thing is that everyone thought things would get better on the islands after 10-10-'10.\\\" On that date, the Netherlands Antilles were dismantled and Bonaire, Saba and St. Eustatius fell under direct authority from The Hague. \\\"But it has actually gotten worse, the poor have not benefited from it.\\\" The ombudsman wants the Netherlands to create a so-called 'Caribbean table'. \\\"All departments in The Hague with a task within the Caribbean Netherlands must join in, under the leadership of the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations.\\\" \\u201cGovernment agencies now rely too much on their own tasks, powers and budgets,\\u201d says Van Zutphen. \\\"They do not sufficiently realize that their policy affects vulnerable elderly people in the Caribbean Netherlands.\\\" \\\"Great plan,\\\" says Den Heyer. \\\"But I also want to sit at that table, participate in discussions and participate in decision-making. \\\"The Hague should not be stuck with the elderly, but should also face up to poverty among children. They grow up in poverty. I can predict how children who grow up in poverty will later present themselves in society. While they do have the talents!\\\" The Amsterdam Museum is immediately banning the term 'Golden Age'. The museum sees the step as an opportunity to \\\"enable inclusivity and other perspectives on that time\\\", it reports on its website. The seventeenth century was nicknamed the 'Golden Age' because the Netherlands was an economic and military world power in this century, says curator Tom van der Molen. \\\"The term ignores negative aspects such as poverty, war, forced labor and human trafficking.\\\" Van der Molen does not dispute that art and painting in particular flourished in this period, but that is no reason for him to call the seventeenth century the Golden Age. The term would also help to see this century from the perspective of those in power at the time. By no longer using it, the museum hopes to provide space for people and stories \\\"that are not yet heard\\\". The permanent exhibition \\\"Dutchmen of the Golden Age\\\" in the Amsterdam wing of the Hermitage is now called \\\"Group portraits of the 17th century\\\". From \\\"falsification of history\\\" and \\\"self-loathing\\\" to \\\"a good idea\\\". The Amsterdam Museum's plan to ban the term 'Golden Age' is causing many reactions. According to the museum, the nickname of the 17th century ignores the negative aspects of that century, such as poverty, war and slavery. \\\"We realized that we can use the term '17th century' better,\\\" museum director Judikje Kiers said this morning in the NOS Radio 1 Journaal. \\\"This gives us space to recolor the image of that period.\\\" But not everyone agrees with that reasoning. Prime Minister Rutte sighed in his weekly press conference: \\\"What nonsense this is. I can't do anything with this.\\\" He thinks the 'Golden Age' is a wonderful term for a time that we can be \\\"rightly proud\\\" of. \\\"The Region of Holland was just as powerful then as the United States is now. This was the place of the great seafarers, the great inventors and the great artists. And yes, there were aspects of it that we now say: ai. But those you can also just name it.\\\" Minister Van Engelshoven (D66) of Education, Culture and Science also does not know whether it is wise to delete the term Golden Age. \\\"For me it is both the 17th century and the Golden Age. That's what we call it. It was also a golden age for trade and art.\\\" The minister does believe that all sides of the 17th century should be highlighted. \\\"But naming in museums is really a choice of the museum itself. You have to make your own decision.\\\" Minister Slob is \\\"very tired\\\" of the question of which term we should use: VVD MP El Yassini said he fell from his chair when he heard the news about the Golden Age. \\\"First the street signs had to go, then the statues and now the entire Golden Age,\\\" he said in the NOS Radio 1 Journaal. \\\"I would rather have the Amsterdam Museum explain what the Golden Age brought to our country and what its negative sides are. That is also the task of a museum.\\\" According to El Yassini, no name change is necessary to carry out that task. \\\"We should not suddenly experience a Golden Age embarrassment. Soon we will no longer know our own history.\\\" Director Kiers of the Amsterdam Museum acknowledges that the term Golden Age can still be used in certain contexts, but that the word 'gold' does not cover all the stories from that century. \\\"Of course the 17th century was the Golden Age of painting, we experienced incredible prosperity in that period and we had relative religious tolerance that meant a lot to Amsterdam.\\\" But, Kiers says: \\\"I also think it is important to give space to other stories.\\\" According to the museum director, some of the visitors sometimes asked questions about this. \\\"Was Amsterdam in the 17th century only made up of rich people? And weren't there also people of color living there? We are now trying to give substance to that and the term 17th century fits better.\\\" The Amsterdam Rijksmuseum, where many rooms are also dedicated to the 17th century, has announced that it will maintain the term Golden Age. \\\"The name refers to a period in history of great prosperity,\\\" director Taco Dibbits told NOS. \\\"That does not alter the fact that we recognize the dark side of this. The Rijksmuseum approaches history from different perspectives. For example, we will open an exhibition about slavery next year.\\\" Earlier this year, attention was also paid to the dark sides of Dutch history. Then Minister Van Engelshoven announced that she would have the Canon of the Netherlands amended, the overview of national history. The American-Dutch historian James Kennedy will lead the evaluation of the canon. The new version is expected to be ready in the spring of 2020. A quarter of all tenants cannot make ends meet financially because their housing costs are too high. This is the conclusion of Nibud in two studies that examined the affordability of housing in the Netherlands for the first time. This concerns approximately 800,000 households that, according to Nibud, are not surviving financially. The conclusions are based on CBS figures from 2015. Later figures are not yet available. The problems mainly affect people who live in social housing. This mainly concerns singles, people on benefits and tenants between 25 and 45 years old. One setback could force them to cut back on normal necessities. If this group has to deal with other unavoidable expenses such as healthcare costs, less will be spent on essential items such as food, Nibud concludes. \\\"We did not expect that such a large proportion of tenants in the social sector have such high housing costs that they are in fact financially strapped,\\\" says Nibud director Arjan Vliegenthart. \\\"They can't buy, and they can't go to a cheaper home.\\\" 800,000 tenants do not have enough money left over for living expenses. But reports indicate more renters are struggling financially. In total, 50 percent of tenants have difficulty making ends meet. According to Nibud, almost 30 percent have payment arrears. Homeowners also sometimes have housing costs that are too high. But that percentage is much lower, at 8 percent. Based on the same figures, the Central Bureau of Statistics reported in 2016 that 18 percent of tenants 'live in expensively crooked housing' and are therefore experiencing financial difficulties. The fact that Nibud now mentions a different percentage (25 percent) is because different criteria were used in both studies. Nibud realizes that the figures date from 2015, but assumes that the situation is not brighter at the moment. In the meantime, steps have been taken to improve the affordability of rental housing, but according to Vliegenthart they do not go far enough. Steven Kromhout of research agency Rigo sees it differently. \\\"More recent figures from the PBL indicate a significant improvement,\\\" he says. After 2015, corporations started to allocate more appropriately, meaning that low-income households live less often in more expensive social housing. More people also have a job, which has increased their income, adds Frans Schilder of the PBL. But the problem that tenants spend too much of their income on housing still exists, according to Kromhout, although it is not clear exactly how many people are affected by it. Nibud sees a solution in lowering rents. But Aedes, the interest group for housing associations, says that associations cannot do that. \\\"We are already doing a lot to keep rent affordable,\\\" says an Aedes spokesperson. \\\"There is a lower limit. It is impossible to go any lower.\\\" The spokesperson points to the significantly increased WOZ value. \\\"We have an enormous tax burden, which will become even higher. Because the rental tax that corporations have to pay for their homes is linked to the WOZ value.\\\" The interest group believes that more needs to be done to increase the income of people in social housing. \\\"So that the wages of these people increase,\\\" says a spokesperson. According to him, the only way in which housing costs for tenants can decrease is by increasing rent allowance. \\\"But that's what politics is about.\\\" The Amsterdam Museum's plan to ban the term 'Golden Age' is currently causing many reactions. According to the museum, the term does not need to be completely abolished, but there should be more room for the dark side of this period. Big brother The Rijksmuseum is not participating in the adjustment. View the considerations of the two museums here: Prime Minister Rutte calls the museum's action \\\"nonsense that he cannot do anything with\\\" and Minister Slob is \\\"very tired\\\" of these types of discussions. Historian Karwan Fatah-Black thinks it is good that the conversation about this is being had. The discussion about the use of the term Golden Age is not new. According to Fatah-Black, a so-called Golden Age hype has been going on for about 20 years. \\\"Museums are very happy to stick the title of the Golden Age on an exhibition as long as it took place in the seventeenth century, they are unashamedly very happy with that Golden Age marketing.\\\" The Golden Age often refers to the 'successful' period in which the Netherlands was an economic and military world power. But it was also a period with a lot of poverty, war and slavery. And that side is often missing, according to Fatah-Black. But that seems to be changing. \\\"You see the development in museums that they are now increasingly open to critical ideas. That they no longer just want to show the beautiful things.\\\" For example, the Maritime Museum no longer uses the term Golden Age simply for some time. \\\"And I see that museums that organize new exhibitions are much more careful about it. That time is no longer naturally called 'gold'.\\\" Fatah-Black finds it striking that the discussion about the term is now flaring up again. \\\"I find it interesting to see how strongly there is a response from politicians. That says something about the thought process we are all in.\\\" And he thinks that's a good thing. \\\"These kinds of themes are what keep us together. It doesn't always feel nice, but we are discussing it. Although I do think that the people who want to maintain the term should better explain what is so 'gold' to this period. Then you only broaden the knowledge we have about it.\\\" Fatah-Black understands that the Golden Age is not the right term for this period for everyone. Although he doesn't think the alternative of 'the seventeenth century' really covers it either. \\\"I think that's too businesslike. I would like it if there was something new. That we agree that the term 'gold' may no longer be so appropriate.\\\" His solution? \\\"We can organize a competition for it. It has been a special time, so something nice that covers the load seems worth a national debate to me.\\\" The G40, the forty large and medium-sized municipalities, are sounding the alarm. They say they will be short of about half a billion euros over the next four years. If the government does not step in, cuts will have to be made, for example on swimming pools, libraries and support for people with less money. Three G40 directors expressed their concerns in the Algemeen Dagblad the day before Budget Day. One of them is Willem-Jan Stegeman, Alderman for Finance in Amersfoort and chairman of the G40 Finance theme group. In the NOS Radio 1 Journaal he said that all municipalities notice that the government is spending less money. \\\"A municipality's budget is largely fixed,\\\" says Stegeman. \\u201cWe need to give people welfare benefits and the roads need to be maintained.\\u201d According to him, it is therefore easier to cut back on swimming pools, libraries and other facilities. \\\"Poverty policy can also be cut back. The question then is whether people who are just above the minimum income can still participate in extras such as sports activities.\\\" According to Stegeman, the government has agreed to spend an additional 5.4 billion euros, but that is not happening. \\\"The economy is doing well now, but the government is spending less money.\\\" The health insurance premium will increase next year, the deductible will remain the same and the health care allowance will be increased. This is stated in the budget of the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport. The government will spend 88.2 billion euros on healthcare next year. That is more than 3 billion euros more than last year. The amount is the sum of expenditure in the context of the Health Insurance Act, the long-term care and care that municipalities provide through youth care and the Social Support Act. The government expects the health insurance premium to increase by about 3 euros per month. The average health insurance premium will then be 118.50 euros. This prediction is uncertain, because health insurers are in charge of it. In the coming months they will announce how high the premiums will be. The deductible will not increase and therefore remains 385 euros. This is in accordance with the coalition agreement, in which it has been agreed that the deductible will not increase during this government's term of office. To compensate for the increased premium for people with a low income, the government is increasing the health care allowance. Singles receive more than 5 euros extra per month, multi-person households about 8 euros. A number of things have been added to the basic package. For example, care provided by a geriatric specialist and a doctor for the mentally handicapped will from now on be reimbursed from the basic package. The same applies to a number of new drugs against cancer and MS. About two billion euros of the healthcare budget goes to indexing wages in the sector. In 2020, an additional 300 million will go to municipalities for youth care. That amount was already announced in the Spring Memorandum. Nursing home care will receive 500 million to improve quality. That was also already known. Healthcare expenditure increases every year and is one of the largest government expenditure items. It is striking that from 2013 to 2018, healthcare expenditure grew less rapidly than the economy, despite the greater demand for healthcare due to, among other things, an aging population. Healthcare costs per adult have increased. This year it amounted to 5,458 euros per person, next year it will be 70 euros more. Healthcare costs per adult are rising by an average of 4.1 percent per year, while wages are rising by an average of 2.1 percent per year. The government warns of increasing healthcare costs and the tight healthcare labor market. That is why it wants to come up with new proposals before the summer of next year to organize healthcare differently in the future. After the rain of cuddly toys for the patients of the Sophia Children's Hospital last weekend in the Rotterdam Kuip, 20,000 euros was raised with the remaining cuddly toys, Rijnmond reports. Supporters of ADO Den Haag were allowed to take four thousand cuddly toys to their club's away match in Rotterdam. The remaining 20,000 collected cuddly toys have been adopted for 1 euro each. That money goes to the Sophia Children's Hospital. The adopted cuddly toys go to food banks, Sinterklaas organizations, hospitals, organizations for the disabled and to refugee children on the Greek island of Lesbos. \\\"The only thing we ask of the hospital is that they do something tangible for the children with the money,\\\" says co-initiator of the campaign Marc Weterings. He points out that the party isn't over yet: there are still \\\"some hugs\\\" left. These can also be adopted. The final amount may therefore still increase. The government of Sint Maarten has fallen. Prime Minister Leona Marlin-Romeo's cabinet no longer had a majority after the departure of MP Franklin Meyer at the beginning of this month and has now lost two more seats in parliament. Marlin-Romeo has sent parliament home and new elections are coming. It is not yet known when they will be. Sint Maarten has been an independent country within the Dutch Kingdom since 2010. It is the ninth time in ten years that the country's government has fallen. Parliament has only fifteen seats, and coalitions often rely on a narrow majority. The power of a seat is therefore great. The two parliamentarians who have now withdrawn their support are Chanel Brownbill and Luc Mercelina of the United Democrats. Both will continue as independent members of Parliament while retaining their seats. Brownbill said he made this decision because of the \\\"uncertainty in the country.\\\" Mercelina, in turn, believes that little progress is being made in the reconstruction of the island. According to him, poverty on the island has increased. Former Prime Minister William Marlin, now in opposition, immediately announced a new coalition after the pair's announcement. His National Alliance would have a majority together with Brownbill, Mercelina and the USP of Francis Richardson, who was arrested this month on suspicion of abuse of power, bribery and forgery. But because Prime Minister Marlin-Romeo sent parliament home, the former prime minister's plan did not go ahead. Queen M\\u00e1xima is proud of what she has achieved over the past ten years as special advocate of the Secretary General of the United Nations. She lobbies foreign heads of state and government to give as many people as possible access to financial services, especially those in poor countries with little money. The queen is not done with her work yet, she emphasized in an interview with NOS in New York. \\u201cWe have helped more than 1.2 billion people with financial services, but there are still 1.7 billion more to go.\\u201d In the interview, M\\u00e1xima talks about her highlight during the past ten years at the UN. Yesterday, M\\u00e1xima's tenth UN anniversary was celebrated during the annual meeting in New York. Secretary General Guterres, among others, spoke warmly about her. UN Secretary General Guterres thanked the Queen for the past ten years: In the past year, the Queen was also discredited because of her UN work. This happened after she spoke with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the G20 summit in Japan. While the UN is pushing for a criminal investigation into his role in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. A number of MPs were, to say the least, surprised that the conversation between M\\u00e1xima and the Saudi crown prince had been approved. The news that the Dutch government supports the Queen's UN work with 150,000 euros annually also led to varying reactions last weekend. According to M\\u00e1xima, her work is going well, especially since it has become easier to measure since 2011. \\u201cMore than 50 countries have developed inclusive finance strategies. Poverty has been reduced and families have greater access to money for food and education,\\u201d the Queen said. For example, she proudly tells how the head of the central bank in Tanzania called a year after setting up a strategy to say that the goals had to be adjusted. M\\u00e1xima: \\\"Because it went too well. That proves that it works.\\\" She should therefore not think about quitting for the time being. However, she emphasizes that her priorities lie with her work as queen. \\\"I therefore try to travel as effectively as possible and I discuss a lot over the telephone. But it gives me a lot of energy. And as long as it gives me energy and can make a difference, I will continue to do it.\\\" The chairman of the UN body that represents M\\u00e1xima, Tilman Ehrbeck, does not want her to leave anytime soon. \\u201cShe knows how to tell a compelling story. The data shows that we are moving in the right direction and she knows how to bring sectors together. She does it masterfully,\\u201d says Ehrbeck. \\\"And yes, she opens doors as queen. There are few who can arrange an appointment with just about anyone in the world. But then you still have to know how to deliver a message. She is one of the most successful special envoys I have ever met. know and she is far from being allowed to retire.\\\" Tenants in the social sector are increasingly experiencing nuisance. This is evident from the biannual Housing Nuisance Housing Monitor 2019 from the umbrella organization of housing associations Aedes. This mainly concerns noise pollution and night-time nuisance caused by people with psychological problems. \\\"It's really bad,\\\" says Marnix Norder, chairman of Aedes, in the NOS Radio 1 Journaal. \\\"It concerns people who turn the volume up to 10 in the middle of the night or throw their household goods - sofas and chairs - down from three floors.\\\" Aedes surveyed almost two hundred housing associations in the Netherlands for the monitor. They are very concerned about this nuisance to neighbors. More than 80 percent of corporations see an increase in reports of confused behavior. The problem mainly arises because tenants with psychological problems continue to live independently for longer without proper guidance, due to the shortage within healthcare. In addition, the social rental sector is reserved for people with a very low income, a group that relatively often faces psychological problems. Norder: \\\"Those people live between you and me and that is fine in itself, but what is happening now is that people often do not receive enough care. And then things get out of hand with local residents, because they accept that at a certain point. moment no more.\\u201d And the problem is only getting worse, he says. \\\"If a home becomes available now, one in two new tenants will be someone with problems. And that can really make life in a social rental home unbearable.\\\" This means that in a porch where one person used to live who needed a little more attention due to, for example, an alcohol problem, there are now sometimes six of those people living there. \\\"The quality of life in entire neighborhoods is thus deteriorating in its entirety.\\\" Housing associations themselves are also more likely to deal with problems associated with (confused) tenants, such as neglect and pollution of the home. There has also been a significant increase in aggressive behavior against corporation employees. \\u201cAnd that is completely unacceptable,\\u201d says Norder. 46 percent of housing associations received reports about this, compared to 34 percent in 2017. Aedes is concerned about this and wants better cooperation with healthcare providers, for example. \\\"Our caretakers, the people who are often the first to identify problems, are at a loss if they have to call someone at 10 p.m. because one care provider only works until 5 p.m. and the other says: it's my job. not,\\\" said Nordber. Rotterdam has found money to organize the Eurovision Song Contest next year. 11.5 million will be taken from this year's budget for projects that were planned but not yet implemented. In this way, Rotterdam wants to prevent cuts in poverty reduction or safety. Among the projects where the money will be withdrawn are plans to improve the outdoor space in the Crooswijk district, automation projects and housing for municipal services. Because this money will not be spent this year, it can go to a special pot for the Eurovision Song Contest, the Rotterdam council says. In total, the Eurovision Song Contest costs the municipality 15.5 million euros. The province of South Holland will pay one million of this. More than three million comes from the municipal events fund and the budget for culture. From 2021, boys will also be vaccinated against the HPV virus. Now only girls are vaccinated against the virus that causes cervical cancer, among other things. State Secretary Blokhuis is including the vaccination in the National Vaccination Program for all children. He is therefore following the advice of the Health Council. In the Netherlands, about 1,000 women and 500 men now get cancer from the virus every year. In women this mainly concerns cervical cancer, in men it concerns mouth, throat, anus and penis cancer. More than 300 women and almost 200 men die from it. Blokhuis says that offering boys the HPV vaccine kills two birds with one stone. \\\"Boys are then protected against the virus and are therefore less likely to contract terrible diseases. Moreover, both boys and girls are even better protected through group protection,\\\" he says. The State Secretary has also decided to lower the age at which the HPV injection is given; from 13 to 9 years. The Health Council had also previously advised Blokhuis on this. Girls have been vaccinated against the virus since 2010. According to Blokhuis, the turnout has never been as high as this year; of girls born in 2006, 65 percent received their first injection. The State Secretary calls this good news. He does not know what caused the increase, but the increased attention to vaccination in general may have contributed to it, he wrote to the House of Representatives. The government must allocate extra money to combat the teacher shortage and tax reductions for the elderly and people with low incomes. If this does not happen, the PvdA threatens to vote against the Tax Plan and the education budget. Today, during the General Financial Considerations, the debate in the House of Representatives on the budget for next year, party leader Lodewijk Asscher will attempt to adjust the cabinet's plans. According to Asscher, money is not the problem, but it is about the political choice of what to do with that money. He says in the NOS Radio 1 Journaal: \\\"We find it inexplicable that at a time when there are all kinds of surpluses, you are putting people with a low income, the elderly and tenants at a disadvantage. They are now experiencing an almost invisible improvement in purchasing power. But if the economy turns bad, those groups will be left out in the cold.\\\" He sees it as an investment in the future, for example by supporting teachers now. \\\"Because they provide quality to society. So it is good for the Netherlands, good for the people in this country. And we know that it is possible now and that it may become much more difficult again later, when the economy is weaker.\\\" The question is whether the PvdA's threat will make an impression. Although the cabinet needs support from the opposition in the Senate, GroenLinks leader Jesse Klaver has already said that he does not intend to vote against the Tax Plan. Klaver no longer wants to practice 'scoreboard politics' and also sees many good things in the Tax Plan. If GroenLinks indeed supports the proposals, the cabinet will have the desired majority. Asscher says his goal is not to stop the plans, but to improve them. \\\"It is up to the cabinet to look for a majority. They can do that, for example, with Forum for Democracy, GroenLinks or with the Labor Party. But you cannot expect us to blindly support plans that do not catch our eyes enough. meet what is needed now.\\\" The PvdA leader already attempted to have his demands met two weeks ago during the General Deliberations, but the cabinet did not respond. Today, in the debate with Minister Hoekstra, Asscher hopes for rapprochement. In addition to the extra money for teachers and tax relief for the elderly and minimum income, the PvdA also wants to do something about the landlord levy that housing associations pay. According to Asscher, this will lead to higher rents, while the money could be better used to build affordable housing. Political reporter Xander van der Wulp says that it is clear that Asscher's political antenna is in order. \\\"He knows that the PvdA is one of the parties, given the coalition's minority in the Senate, that can demand things from the cabinet in the near future. And this is the right time to put your wishes on the table.\\\" During the General Political Considerations, right after Budget Day, it became clear \\\"that the cabinet is quite prepared to look to the left,\\\" says Van der Wulp. The Council of State has reprimanded the Tax Authorities because the tax authorities have wrongly stopped the housing allowance of an as yet unknown number of people. The consumer program Kassa will pay attention to this tonight. According to the Woonbond, this may involve hundreds of people. The rental allowance was stopped because the tenants temporarily had too much money in their account and their rent had risen too much. People with a low income can receive housing allowance up to a maximum rental price of 720 euros. Due to the annual rent increases, many have to pay more than 720 euros per month over time. As long as the tenant continues to live in the same house, this was not a problem for housing benefit. But that changed if the tenant temporarily had too much assets, for example due to a paid severance payment. By the time the tenant was below the asset limit again, according to the tax authorities, he could not receive housing allowance again because the rent is now above 720 euros. However, the Council of State ruled last summer that tenants in such cases are again entitled to rent allowance, in a case brought by an affected tenant. What are the limits of housing allowance in 2019? Maximum rent: 720.42 euros Maximum income under state pension age: 22,700 euros (single) or 30,825 euros (multiple person) Maximum income over state pension age: 22,675 euros (single) or 30,800 euros (multiple person) Maximum assets (savings) : 30,360 euros per person (Source: Woonbond.nl) It is not clear how many people have been disadvantaged. According to Marcel Trip of the Woonbond, \\\"it is very difficult to put a number on this.\\\" This may involve hundreds and perhaps thousands of affected tenants. In the worst cases, people had to move because they could not afford the rent without benefits, says Trip. CDA MPs Pieter Omtzigt and Erik Ronnes have asked Minister Ollongren (Interior) and State Secretary Snel (Finance) whether the Tax Authorities still wrongly refuse to grant rent allowance again in these types of cases, and how many tenants have been affected. According to a spokesperson for the Ministry of Finance, it is also not clear to the Tax Authorities how many tenants are involved. \\\"We can't get that out of the systems with one or two hours of work,\\\" he says. According to the spokesperson, the Tax Authorities do follow the applicable laws and regulations. This means that since the ruling of the Council of State last summer, tenants have again received housing allowance if their assets have been temporarily too high and their rent has risen to above 720 euros in the meantime. It is not yet clear how affected tenants will be dealt with before the ruling this summer. A spokesperson for the Ministry of the Interior says that this still needs to be discussed between the ministries. The tax authorities are already under fire because a large group of parents wrongly lost their childcare allowance. The tax authorities did not want to admit that the service was wrong in the case, while parents encountered major financial problems. Last summer, State Secretary Snel promised that parents would receive compensation in this case. Many elderly people on Bonaire lead an inhumane existence, the National Ombudsman noted last month. People over 65 have to survive on a state pension that is far too low, while the costs of living are only increasing. Today the House of Representatives is discussing this issue during the Kingdom Relations budget debate. Mrs. Romana Boezem (87) is one of the 2,500 elderly people on Bonaire who has to make ends meet with such a low AOV (the Caribbean version of the Dutch AOW). It does not work. To have extra income, she knits woolen hats for four euros each. But selling is not easy, because she has difficulty walking. Our correspondent Dick Drayer visited Mrs. Boezem on Bonaire: A look into her refrigerator reveals the poverty. There is virtually nothing in it. But she is not hungry, she says. In the kitchen she makes funchi with diluted milk powder and corn porridge. She eats that seven days a week, every day of the month, all year round. Sometimes she has a little vegetable with it, but she doesn't eat anything else. Shopping on Saba, St. Eustatius and Bonaire is expensive. For a cucumber that retails for 75 cents in the Netherlands, you pay 3.18 euros on Bonaire. A liter of freshly squeezed orange juice costs 3.09 euros at the Zaanse supermarket, while in the branch of the same supermarket in Kralendijk on Bonaire you pay 5.45 euros. An old-age pension for a single person over 65 on Bonaire is 586 euros per month. Research agency Regioplan, commissioned by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment, has calculated that this should actually be 1,385 euros, the so-called subsistence minimum. Skipping meals \\\"Most elderly people run out of money halfway through the month,\\\" says Filomena Winklare. She works as an elderly care worker at a day care center. There are three of these on the island. In addition to daytime activities, the elderly also receive a meal there. \\\"But they are closed at the weekend and many people skip their meals. Moreover, there are only a limited number of places at day care. Most elderly people are left out.\\\" Netherlands The Caribbean islands are themselves responsible for the prices. But the amount of pensions and benefits is determined in The Hague. Ten years after the accession of Saba, St. Eustatius and Bonaire to the Dutch government, the Netherlands has not yet managed to substantially increase the subsistence level. State Secretary for Social Affairs and Employment, Tamara van Ark, has promised to increase pensions step by step. The target amount for a single person, who currently receives 586 euros, has been set at approximately 864 euros per month on Bonaire. According to the research agency, still too low, but the cabinet wants Bonaire and the private sector to do something: the cost of living must be reduced. Bonaire has little confidence in a quick solution to the poverty problem. Ten years after the island left the Netherlands Antilles and came under direct authority from The Hague, poverty is still a major problem. While most residents had hoped for a progressive Dutch government. Van Ark understands the sensitivities in this debate, but emphasizes that all parties must contribute: \\\"The Hague cannot do it alone.\\\" Children who are born prematurely suffer from this for much longer later in life than expected. Even in puberty they still notice the consequences. Sabrina Twilhaar of the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam comes to this conclusion in a study for which she will receive her PhD today. \\\"Those children have more difficulty keeping up at school,\\\" Twilhaar says in the NOS Radio 1 Journaal. \\\"They have lower intelligence on average and they more often suffer from social problems and attention problems.\\\" The damage occurs because the brain undergoes important development in the last three months of pregnancy, which is disrupted in the event of premature birth. \\\"A child is then born with a body that is far from ready to be exposed to the world outside the womb,\\\" Twilhaar explains. \\\"This makes it vulnerable to infections and complications, which has an adverse effect on brain development and can even lead to brain damage.\\\" A pregnancy normally lasts between 37 and 42 weeks. If a baby is born after a pregnancy of less than 37 weeks, the World Health Organization defines it as a premature birth. A premature birth with a gestational age of less than or equal to 32 weeks is called 'extreme prematurity'. Preventing children from being born much too early would therefore be the best scenario, but that is not yet possible. The number of premature births is not yet decreasing and more and more premature children are surviving. Yet something can be done about the problems, Twilhaar thinks. \\\"It is very important that we will be much better able to predict which children will have problems and which will not. There are very large differences within the group of prematurely born children.\\\" \\\"At the moment we cannot actually predict which children will experience developmental problems. If we can do this better, we can keep a better eye on those children and hopefully identify problems earlier, so that we can provide timely help. This can be done before they go to go to school. The earlier you can provide the right support, the better you can prevent major problems.\\\" This year's Nobel Prize in economics goes to three economists who have conducted research into combating poverty. For the second time in history, a woman receives the prize. The three acclaimed economists are Esther Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee (both at MIT) and Michael Kremer (Harvard). In an initial reaction, Duflo, born in 1972, indicated that she was surprised by the news. \\\"I thought we were too young for the prize. Most of the winners are much older.\\\" The committee calls the fight against global poverty, in all its forms, one of humanity's most urgent issues. Despite significant progress in recent decades, more than 700 million people still live on extremely low incomes. Every year, approximately 5 million children under the age of five die from diseases that could often be cheaply treated or prevented. According to Duflo, the poor are often caricatured, portraying them as \\\"desperate, lazy or not enterprising\\\". Even people who want to help don't understand where poverty comes from, Duflo said. Her research, and that of her colleagues, seeks to examine all aspects of poverty separately to find an effective solution. The three researchers will receive the prize for their innovative research methods. They showed that the best solutions can be found if a study is divided into more specific questions, which are then investigated using small experiments. Take, for example, the problem that many people have little or no education, one of the major causes of poverty. In low-income countries, textbooks are scarce, and children often go to school without enough to eat. Is it most effective to provide more books, or are free school meals the best solution? It was Michael Kremer who and his colleagues decided in the 1990s to move their research from the university to where the problem occurred: rural Western Kenya. There they investigated various possible solutions. It turned out that more books or free textbooks did not really improve learning results. It took other experiments to find out what does work. This made it clear that the biggest problem is that education in these areas does not properly meet the needs of students. Esther Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee were at the forefront of these studies, and also conducted experiments with guidance programs in India. That clearly appeared to have an effect. According to the Nobel Committee, the three winners have paved the way for a more effective fight against poverty. Their approach has now become leading for the entire field. A sum of more than 800,000 euros will be divided among the three researchers. When asked what Duflo will do with the money, she referred to the two-time Nobel Prize winner Marie Curie, a physicist and chemist. \\\"When she won, she bought a gram of radium. The three of us will discuss and see what our gram of radium is.\\\" In The Hague, a small group of farmers concluded their two-day protest with a tour on a tractor past various authorities. The 'Tour de Boer' visited, among others, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Netherlands Enterprise Agency. There, farmers once again highlighted their objections to the nitrogen measures. It was briefly a question whether farmers would be allowed to make the journey through the city with their tractor. The municipality ultimately gave permission because it involved a limited number of demonstrators. The Binnenhof remained off-limits to farmers even today. Just like yesterday, Defense trucks were there to stop them. At the end of the morning they left The Hague via the A12. The police drove along to warn other traffic about the tractors on the highway. The second day of the farmers' protest started this morning with an extensive breakfast for residents of The Hague. The protesting farmers wanted to give something back for the traffic nuisance they caused yesterday. At the Hofvijver, sandwiches, fried eggs and shawarma were served. According to the organization, there was enough food for 5,000 people. Afterwards it turned out that there was still a lot left, so the food banks were called to collect the remaining food. View photos of the breakfast here: After the farmers' protest by thousands of farmers, most of them returned to the farm last night. Dozens of farmers stayed, for fun or to continue their campaign today. There was an afterparty for those who stayed behind, which lasted until the small hours. The consequences of this were still noticeable this morning. \\\"I encountered a few people who were barely approachable,\\\" said reporter Roel Pauw. The farmers had set up a temporary camp with tents and caravans. If they would behave, that would not be a problem, the municipality had said in advance. Some tried to spend the night in their tractor. \\u201cWe initially thought the tractor was a good place to sleep,\\u201d said a young farmer. \\\"We kept that up for two hours, but then we just lay down in the caravan among the boys.\\\" About the can of energy drink in his hand: \\\"You should have breakfast. I don't have a coffee maker in the tractor.\\\" They didn't want another day of action against the nitrogen rules after a wet afterparty. \\\"We all got soaking wet last night, so in the meantime we feel like sitting at home by the stove again.\\\" For him, home is in Ede, a few hours' drive away on back roads. The food bank in Nijmegen has received a special present from the tax investigation service (FIOD) and the Public Prosecution Service. In April, the FIOD found a load of washing powder weighing 16,000 kilos, which scammers wanted to put in counterfeit boxes of a well-known brand. Such a find is normally destroyed. But according to the FIOD, the powder is of excellent quality and the service has therefore decided to take it to the food bank. The boxes have been destroyed. The food bank says it is very happy with the gift. The powder was in bags on pallets in a warehouse in Wijchen, near Nijmegen. There were also stacks of boxes of a well-known brand of detergent. At the manufacturer's request, the FIOD does not want to say which brand. According to the FIOD, it now smells wonderful at the Nijmegen Food Bank. It is not wise for Willem-Alexander and M\\u00e1xima to have friends with an outspoken political profile. For his credibility as king of all Dutch people, it is important that Willem-Alexander stands above the parties. It is not without reason that the king has the right to vote, but never votes. Reporter Kysia Hekster writes a monthly royal family column for NOS.nl. Yet the Dutch royal couple are close friends with the - not without controversy - Argentine President Mauricio Macri and his wife Juliana Awada. M\\u00e1xima first met Macri in January 2016, at the World Economic Forum in Davos. He had just become president of Argentina. Apparently she got along well with M\\u00e1xima, who was extremely popular in her native country. Because at the end of that year, King Willem-Alexander and M\\u00e1xima and their three daughters spent Christmas together with the Argentine presidential couple and their daughter Antonia in Patagonia, where M\\u00e1xima's aunt runs a hotel. A few months earlier, Maxima posed with the president, his wife and their daughter when she visited the country for her UN work. In March 2017, Macri and his wife came on a state visit to the Netherlands. Prior to that visit, they slept at Het Loo Palace in Apeldoorn and visited the Dutch royal couple privately at the Eikenhorst, where the Oranges lived at the time. Last November, at the invitation of the Argentine president, M\\u00e1xima was in her native country for the G20, the twenty largest economies in the world, for her UN work. She was given an honorary place in the group photo, right behind the Argentine presidential couple. Macri's wife Juliana was also at the funeral of M\\u00e1xima's sister In\\u00e9s. At the beginning of this year, the Dutch royal couple and their daughters again dined with the Argentine president and his wife, Argentine media wrote. Of course, the royal couple can choose their own friends. But Macri is not without controversy. During the state visit to the Netherlands, a demonstration was held by Hijos Nederland, an organization of children whose parents disappeared during the Videla regime in Argentina. The organization accuses the Argentine president of \\\"ruling by decree, advocating milder sentences for war criminals and imprisoning human rights activists.\\\" Last year, Amnesty International also raised concerns about signs of the erosion of the right to demonstrate and freedom of expression under Macri. In 2015, he won the elections with the promise to end the economic crisis and poverty. But he did not keep that promise. There are presidential elections in Argentina on Sunday. It looks like Macri may lose it in the first round. Most likely there will soon be a new president, Alberto Fern\\u00e1ndez, who will have no interest in Macri's political course. He is probably also a lot more distant towards his friends, including Willem-Alexander and M\\u00e1xima. This may not have immediate consequences in the Netherlands. But the friendship with one president can negatively influence contacts with another, new head of state of Argentina. It is therefore important that the king safeguards his political impartiality - which is essential in the constitutional monarchy - also internationally. She was a singer, dancer and a well-known artist. But also a resistance hero and spy. The American-French Josephine Baker performed throughout Europe during the Second World War and managed to smuggle people in hiding or people from the resistance into her orchestra. The scores contain not only musical notes, but also secret messages. It is these mysterious stories that can now be viewed in a pub in Overasselt, close to Nijmegen. According to the owners, Baker also performed there. Josephine Baker was born in 1906 in St. Louis, United States. After a childhood in poverty, she made a career as a dancer on Broadway. Later she went to Europe, where she also started acting. In 1937 she obtained French nationality through her marriage to a Frenchman. Baker stood out for her erotic dancing, during which she was scantily dressed on stage. During the Second World War she did resistance work in France, for which she received various awards. After the war, Baker campaigned for the rights of African Americans. In 1963, for example, she joined Martin Luther King in the March on Washington. In 1975 she died in Paris of a cerebral hemorrhage. The party room from the 1940s is now a coffee room of Monica Zeegers' funeral home. Following the festivities celebrating 75 years of liberation, she decided to delve into the history of Caf\\u00e9 Van Lin, as the banquet hall used to be called, together with Edwin van Wanrooij. Today the caf\\u00e9 reopens as it must have looked at that time. 'Grandpa Van Lin' played music for the guests on the piano in the corner. The tables are again equipped with carpets with large glass ashtrays. The bar stools feature the flags of the countries where consumers came from in the 1940s: Great Britain, Canada, the United States, Poland and Germany. And on the walls there are photos of visitors, but also of the family tree of the Van Lin family. Josephine Baker's story is proudly displayed in a special exhibition. After the war, there was great doubt whether the famous resistance hero had actually performed in Overasselt, says Edwin van Wanrooij. \\\"Then the visitors said: there's that Van Lin again with his tall stories, but we looked for the evidence and we know for sure. She has been here.\\\" Van Wanrooij and Zeegers checked archives in the Netherlands and France, where Baker lived for a long time. But the proof was eventually provided by a man from Nijmegen with a suitcase full of valuable documents. This included a play list, which was written down in elegant letters in a notebook. \\\"There it is,\\\" Van Wanrooij points out. \\\"December 4 and 5, 1944\\\". A hotel confirmation and that evening's playlist were also in the suitcase. \\\"And then one and one makes two. We were able to reconstruct the entire evening like this. This together with three testimonies from visitors from that time provide sufficient evidence: Baker performed in Overasselt!\\\" said Van Wanrooij. Toilet paper, diapers or cloth: in the United Kingdom, one in ten girls has used these because they could not afford menstrual products. Nearly half of English girls have missed at least one day of school because they lacked menstrual products. In Scotland, where this was even more so, the government made sanitary products free for pupils and students, the first country in the world. It allocated around 6 million euros for this. In the United Kingdom, relatively much is known about this subject because a lot of research has already been done on it. But now research by Plan International, a development organization, also shows that menstrual poverty also occurs in the Netherlands. More than a thousand girls and women between the ages of 12 and 25 were asked about their experiences with menstruation. About one in ten has had problems obtaining menstrual products because there was no money for them. About two percent also said they had sometimes reused a tampon or sanitary towel because of the costs. Feminist platform De Bovengrondse previously conducted research into the subject. The action group spoke to fifty organizations, including various departments of The Salvation Army and the Food Bank in the Netherlands. The Food Banks in Utrecht and Amsterdam estimate that the problem affects hundreds of people there. And menstrual products are also regularly requested from shelters for homeless Dutch people. Not being able to afford menstrual products can cause inconvenience, for example because sanitary towels are not replaced on time. This can lead to irritations or even infections. But in addition to inconvenience, period poverty also causes problems in daily life, such as missing school days. There are examples of this in the United Kingdom. Lorijn de Boer from Bovengrondse investigated the problem in Amsterdam. \\\"Our main conclusion is that period poverty occurs among women around the poverty line. They use newspapers or rags and often cut back on food during their menstruation.\\\" You can often get tampons for as little as one euro, De Boer also notes. Despite that relatively low amount, it can still be complicated to buy enough sanitary products every month. De Boer: \\\"How much you spend per month for your period varies per person. Some women can last an entire period with a pack of tampons, but that does not apply to everyone.\\\" For example, the researchers spoke to a woman in Amsterdam who regularly has heavy periods and gets her period every two weeks. Research showed that an amount of eight euros was average. \\\"But some women indicated that they spent as much as 25 euros per menstruation. On a weekly budget of 50 euros, that is a lot.\\\" According to researchers, it also matters whether you have children. If you have periods with more women in a family, the costs quickly increase. Astrid (full name known to editors) experienced this. She lived around the poverty line for years. \\\"Then I used folded toilet paper instead of sanitary pads. If you have a heavy period, you need more products and that costs a lot of money. Sometimes I used two pads, and then I only changed the front one.\\\" Thanks to a joint income, Astrid now earns a little more, but she and her family still live just above the poverty line. \\\"When I go shopping now, I always try to take one package with me so that I can stock up. Her daughter is now also menstruating, and then it goes quite quickly, she says. \\\"But I make sure that my daughter always has something. I can't afford to send her to school without products.\\\" Access to menstrual products is not only hindered by money, but also by the taboo, say researchers. De Boer: \\\"Women often find it a difficult subject to discuss. to talk. They are ashamed to indicate that they cannot afford sanitary products.\\\" Conversely, the subject is not important to many care providers. \\\"It is not talked about. It is a blind spot.\\\" Exactly how many Dutch people are faced with menstrual poverty is difficult to say, according to the researchers. There is simply not enough large-scale research done yet. According to Mascha Singeling, the fact that there are few studies is due to sanitation and hygiene. expert at Plan International, because poverty and menstruation are rarely discussed. She calls both taboo subjects. \\\"People quickly think: 'Not being able to afford tampons, that doesn't happen in the Netherlands, does it?' That makes it difficult to admit that you don't have the money for it.\\\" The gaming world is preparing for the release of one of the most remarkable games in years. Death Stranding will be in stores on Friday. The game is so unique that game experts are unable to make an unequivocal judgment about it: is it rubbish or a masterpiece? Since the very first trailer, more than three years ago, the gaming world has been captivated by the game. The glimpse showed a naked man on a black sand beach, surrounded by dead sea creatures and a fetus connected to him by a black cable. While crying, he rocked the baby, after which it suddenly disappeared. The remarkable Death Stranding reveal video from 2016: Gamers then really had no idea what the latest and highly anticipated game from renowned game developer Hideo Kojima was about. Three years later, the game is still just as mysterious. Even now that game journalists have already played the game and were able to make their first judgment. From \\\"the best game ever made\\\" (IndieWire) to \\\"a long, bizarre journey that is both breathtaking and boring\\\" (The Verge). The Washington Post calls the game a kind of \\\"Frankenstein\\\" that borrows from all kinds of games, but to which no genre can actually be assigned. Kojima himself calls his creation \\\"a new genre\\\". Death Stranding is set in a post-apocalyptic America, when humanity has been largely wiped out by a disaster. There are only a few underground settlements spread across the country. The mission is then simple: the player must act as a glorified courier to deliver cargo to settlements from the east to the west of the US. During its trek, everything must be taken into account: from the wear of shoes and the weight of the cargo to how full the bladder is. Meanwhile, the wilderness the player crosses is extremely dangerous. There were ghosts everywhere, hunting people. To be able to anticipate the ghosts, the player carries a so-called BB. In other words, a fetus in an artificial womb, which can see the spirits and thus functions as a kind of living alarm. To achieve this, the fetus must be kept happy, for example by physically 'rocking' the controller every now and then. It's not surprising that game developer Rami Ismail has so many different opinions about the game. According to him, Death Stranding is above all the product of Kojima, one of the most striking and original game designers ever. \\\"He is a filmmaker who started making games by accident,\\\" he says about the 56-year-old Japanese. \\\"His games are extremely bizarre and idiosyncratic.\\\" Kojima made his breakthrough in the late 1980s with the first part of his Metal Gear series. He experimented extensively with game elements and achieved world fame with his stories, in which he navigated in a film-like manner between extreme realism and the supernatural. In Death Stranding he goes one step further. Ismail: \\\"In 2015 he left publisher Konami to set up his own studio and there was always the feeling in the industry that Konami was reining him in a bit. Death Stranding is therefore his first game in which he has complete freedom, the result being a kind of bizarre postman simulator,\\u201d says Ismail. In the game the boundary between film and game becomes blurred. For example, intermediate scenes that explain the strange story regularly last longer than half an hour and main character Sam Bridges is played by the well-known The Walking Dead actor Norman Reedus. There is also a social element to the game. Players can help and compliment each other. According to Kojima, the theme of 'connection' is central to his game. In the broadest sense of the word. \\\"Nowadays it's all about the individual, even though we are more connected than ever thanks to the internet,\\\" he told the BBC this week. Nino de Vries, game editor of tech site The Next Web, emphasizes that the buyers of the game are open to this. \\\"Because you spend a lot of time walking with packages on your back.\\\" De Vries has already spent more than seventy hours in the Death Stranding world. He still doesn't know what to think after writing his review. \\u201cIt's easily one of the most remarkable games of the last decade,\\u201d he says. He does not rule out that many people will soon label the game as \\\"garbage\\\" instead of a masterpiece. \\\"But I also like that. Nowadays, these types of big games are mainly made to appeal to a broad audience. That is not the case with Death Stranding.\\\" The risk is that many people will soon bring the game back, he thinks. Game designer Rami Ismail does not expect that mastermind Kojima will lose sleep over this. \\u201cHe mainly makes games for himself,\\u201d he says. Ismail is one of the most successful Dutch game designers. Last year he won a prestigious international prize. Yet he dreams of a status like Kojima's. \\\"In other words, getting a lot of money for your game. Without first having to explain what you are going to make, because there is so much confidence in your talent.\\\" The bee is doing badly. All kinds of initiatives are being set up to combat bee mortality and save the insect, but new French research shows that this is sometimes counterproductive. Many beehives have been installed in Paris in recent years. In 2011 there were about 300 beehives in the city, now there are more than 2000. Good news for the bee, you would think. But not all bees appear to benefit from all those hives. The researchers studied the Parisian public gardens for three years. There they came to the conclusion that the honey bee takes the place of the wild bee. Honeybees are much more active in gathering food. This leaves less nectar and pollen for the other species. Beekeeper Sonne Copijn recognizes the conclusions from the report. She is a director of the Bee Foundation and is committed to the protection of wild bees in the Netherlands. Things are not going well with that, she says in the NOS Radio 1 Journaal. \\\"The Netherlands has the dubious honor of being the leader in the field of endangered bee species. There are 360 \\u200b\\u200bdifferent wild species in the Netherlands. More than half of them are endangered and on a red list,\\\" says Copijn. The wild bee also competes with the honey species in the Netherlands. Copijn says that there are important differences between the two. \\\"Where honey bees make honey, live in colonies and their queen lays up to 2,000 eggs per day, their wild counterparts live solitary and only lay one egg per day. Moreover, they do not make honey.\\\" The French researchers point out that the decline in the number of wild bees could also endanger the production of crops such as peppers and aubergines. The pollination of those crops is done by the wild species. The French researchers therefore fear that biodiversity will decline if more beehives are installed. They therefore call for the removal of bee hives in the city and the planting of more greenery. The problem with bee mortality in the Netherlands is not so much the shortage of hives, but the shortage of food, Copijn explains. \\\"When the mortality started, we all wanted to help the bees by establishing more bee colonies. While we actually need to provide more food.\\\" Copijn explains that the research shows that the type of food is very important. \\\"The wild bee species are much more picky about what they eat. They don't like cultivated crops, only wild plants, such as clover or dandelions.\\\" And it is precisely these that are increasingly disappearing from the Dutch landscape. If we want more bees in the Netherlands, we should not help the honey bee, but something must change in the gardens and fields, says Copijn. \\\"We are now suffering from flower poverty in the Netherlands,\\\" says the bee expert. \\\"The fields used to be yellow with dandelions in the spring, but you hardly see that anymore.\\\" Copijn suggests creating more so-called 'bee oases'. These are areas of grass with all kinds of wild flowers, native shrubs and trees. The wild bee should also soon get its due again. Every year people collect food or money under the banner of the food bank, even though the items do not go there. This is what a spokesperson for the Association of Dutch Food Banks said. \\u201cOur name is being misused.\\u201d It is not known where the collected food will remain. According to the spokesperson, it happens somewhere every year. This year too, it happened. In various places in South Limburg, items have recently been collected at supermarkets by people posing as volunteers from the food bank. People who came to do their shopping bought some extras in the store and gave the product to the fake volunteers. \\\"I didn't know that shape yet and it is very bad,\\\" says the spokesperson. \\\"You sometimes hear about people who come by with collections and say they are from the food bank, but we never collect at home.\\\" Recently, fraudsters have been at supermarkets in Heerlen, Hoensbroek and Stein, reports 1Limburg. At one of those stores, someone said they were collecting items for the food bank in Urmond, but there hasn't been a distribution point there for years. There were also people who said they were collecting food on behalf of the regional broadcaster L1, but that is not correct. L1 has coordinated a major fundraising campaign at Christmas for years, but will not do so this year. Editor-in-chief Leo Hauben. \\\"We support the food bank's major fundraising campaign, but do not hold a collection ourselves.\\\" The real fundraising campaign of the food bank in South Limburg is on Saturday, December 7. There are ways for people shopping to be sure they are dealing with the real food bank, says a spokesperson for the food bank in Limburg-Zuid. \\\"We always announce our actions in advance. Also on the site. In addition, we also wear recognizable food bank body warmers,\\\" he says. \\\"I think the worst thing is that the people who donate think they are giving to us. They are being misled. I think that is stealing from people who already have nothing and that is very low.\\\" The Association of Dutch Food Banks also finds it bad that the name of the food bank is being misused, but not much can be done about it. \\\"It is a free name that anyone can use. The judge finds it too generic.\\\" The food bank does have a logo that may not be used by others. \\\"It's a heart with a fork through it. That logo is legally established.\\\" Hundreds of thousands of people with a minimum income will spend more on their health insurance next year. This is evident from research by the Zorg Kies comparison site. The problem lies with the municipal policy, which is used by about 725,000 people. People with a minimum income can take out collective health insurance through their municipality. The municipality, together with a health insurer, offers a discount so that low incomes have to pay less premium. Some municipalities also pay part of the premium or deductible. Research by Zorgkeuze shows that this municipal policy will become a lot more expensive in many municipalities in 2020. \\\"This is because the health insurer will reduce or completely eliminate the group discount next year,\\\" says Peter Ruys of the Zorg Kies comparison site. The minimum wage may be disadvantaged on two sides: not only is the discount reduced, certain municipalities also cut the financial contribution that low incomes receive for their healthcare costs. \\\"This means that people will sometimes pay 80 to more than 100 euros more per year.\\\" And while the healthcare allowance will only increase by 60 euros in 2020, says Ruys. The government has taken rising healthcare costs into account. That is why the healthcare allowance for people with a low income will increase. But the intention was to slightly improve the purchasing power of this group. That doesn't work for hundreds of thousands of people. \\\"The differences between the municipalities are enormous,\\\" says Ruys. For example, collective health insurance for low-income earners in Leiden will cost about 180 euros more next year, while in Utrecht low-income earners will pay almost 40 euros less, the study shows. Municipalities where the municipal policy is becoming cheaper are significantly in the minority. In Rotterdam, about 60,000 people use the municipal policy of insurer VGZ. Hatice Sevin\\u00e7 also has this municipal policy. She has been reimbursed for fewer and fewer medications in recent years and recently received a letter with the new premium. She is shocked by the amount she will have to pay extra next year: VGZ, the insurer that provides the municipal policy in Rotterdam, is halving the group discount for all customers. So also for the minimums. The government will allow insurers to offer less discounts on the premium for group health insurance in 2020. This measure puts this group at a disadvantage, especially because an increase of a few euros per month can be too much for these people. \\\"I'm very disappointed about it,\\\" says Rotterdam councilor Sven de Langen of Public Health. \\\"Every euro counts for the people of Rotterdam.\\\" The municipality of Rotterdam says it cannot do anything about it and believes that the cabinet must take action. \\\"I hope that the minister will maintain the discount for minimum wage earners.\\\" Insurer CZ, which offers collective health insurance for low incomes in 67 municipalities, says that the policy was no longer sustainable. \\\"It costs us several million per year. We had to make an intervention to be able to offer an affordable premium for all our customers,\\\" says a spokesperson. People who have a municipal policy often use a lot of long-term care, the spokesperson explains. The packages have therefore also been expanded. For example, the dentist is often fully reimbursed and people can receive many physio treatments reimbursed. But, says Ruys van Zorgkeuze, this also makes the premium very high. \\\"In general, people with low incomes have a lot of healthcare costs, but for many people this does not apply.\\\" In that case, such a municipal policy is much too expensive, he says. \\\"The municipality should point out to people that it is an excellent insurance policy, provided you have high healthcare costs.\\\" In a response, Minister Bruins defends the government's measure to limit the group discount to a maximum of 5 percent. According to Bruins, many health insurers first artificially increase the premium and then give a discount later. \\\"I don't think that is a good way of working. A collective discount should be aimed at purchasing something collectively good and passing on the benefit to the people.\\\" According to Bruins, how exactly municipalities deal with the financial contribution to the healthcare costs of low incomes is a matter for the municipalities themselves. He further emphasizes that the government is committed to keeping healthcare costs manageable. The Dutch development bank FMO is involved in abuses on three palm oil plantations in Congo. According to human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW), plantation workers are severely underpaid and work with toxic pesticides without protective clothing. Contaminated waste from the plantations is also dumped into water, which, among other things, leads to contamination of drinking water. The organization conducted research on the plantations for a year and spoke to more than 200 people: FMO is involved in the plantations as a co-financier of Feronia, the company that owns the agricultural land. \\\"As investors, they can therefore make demands when it comes to, for example, the well-being of workers. But as long as this is not done properly, there is a major problem in Congo,\\\" said Jan Kooy of Human Rights Watch in the NOS Radio 1 Journaal. FMO was founded in 1970 by the Dutch government to invest in projects in developing countries. In addition to FMO, development banks from Germany, Belgium and Great Britain are also involved in the abuses on the plantations, according to HRW. The four banks have invested at least 100 million dollars in Feronia since 2013. In a joint statement, the development banks acknowledge the problems on the plantations. But according to the companies, there are \\\"no quick solutions\\\" to challenges in one of the \\\"toughest places on earth\\\". Congo is known as the poorest country in the world. Linda Broekhuizen, investment head at the FMO, says she takes the results of the HRW investigation seriously: \\\"We are aware of most of the concerns in the report.\\\" Broekhuizen emphasized on NPO Radio 1 that the project was on the verge of collapse when FMO decided to invest in Feronia six years ago. A possible bankruptcy would have hit the local population hard, because around 100,000 people depend on the company. Broekhuizen: \\\"And the government is not active locally. That is why the company also invests in houses, schools, hospitals and clean drinking water.\\\" Yet, according to HRW, many employees still live in \\\"total poverty\\\". They earn an average salary of just over one euro per day. \\\"That is below the World Bank's minimum wage, which means you can speak of a dignified existence,\\\" said Jan Kooy of HRW. FMO head Broekhuizen says he has different figures. \\\"The salaries are higher than stated in the report, have improved significantly in recent years and we have the ambition to increase them further.\\\" According to her, that just takes time. \\\"Because the company operates in difficult circumstances.\\\" According to Broekhuizen, the fact that employees have to work without protective clothing is now the FMO's biggest concern. \\\"They did receive that clothing. We want to understand why it is not used and on what scale it is.\\\" HRW's conclusions are not a reason for FMO to withdraw from the project. \\\"Doing nothing is not an option. We will continue to fight as long as we believe this can be made a success.\\\" GroenLinks and the SP want to abolish childcare allowances. With the money this generates, parents should receive three days of free childcare. GroenLinks leader Klaver said this morning in the NOS Radio 1 Journaal that it would not be timely to dismiss State Secretary Snel from Finance because of the problems with the current benefits system. According to him, that doesn't solve anything. He believes that the system is no longer sustainable. \\\"Parents have to pay first and then get money back from the government and that goes wrong in 80 percent of cases.\\\" Tomorrow, when the Social Affairs budget is discussed, Klaver wants to propose offering three days of free childcare to all parents. Anyone who wants more days of care must pay for this themselves. Single parents with a low income receive more days of free childcare under the plan. MP Leijten of the SP thinks it is a good idea. \\\"We already proposed that a few years ago.\\\" According to her, it is also affordable if you tackle the current system of \\\"pumping money around\\\". RTL Nieuws and Trouw report that there is a new problem in the benefits affair. State Secretary Snel has known for some time that the number of victims is much greater than he has admitted. But he allegedly withheld the documents proving this from the House of Representatives. A spokesperson for Snel says that the existence of the documents has indeed been reported to the House. But according to Leijten, the House has received the documents \\\"confidentially\\\". \\\"That means that they are actually still secret\\\" and the MPs can therefore do nothing with them. The SP wants a parliamentary inquiry into childcare allowance. \\\"Because then we can simply go to the ministry with a moving box and say: hand in those documents.\\\" The position of people with disabilities has not improved since the Netherlands signed the UN Handicap Convention. The UN Treaty Alliance states this in a shadow report. It has actually become more difficult to participate fully in society over the past three years. According to the Alliance, unemployment among people with disabilities is rising and more of them are experiencing poverty. There is a shortage of affordable adapted housing and there is a growing number of children who are excluded from the regular school system due to their disabilities. The Alliance consists of five advocates for people with a physical, psychological or mental disability. The shadow report is based on the experiences of people with disabilities and on source research. The findings will be presented to the UN Human Rights Committee in Geneva. One of the organizations in the Alliance is Elke(in). According to director Illya Soffer, there is more attention for people with disabilities, but this has not led to progress. \\\"We see that this attention is almost in vain if you do not arrange other things such as income, labor, education, housing and care much better. You can remove all barriers throughout the Netherlands, but if you have insufficient income or insufficient support, you will just don't leave your house.\\\" 'Minister of Disability Affairs' Rick Brink regularly consults with Minister De Jonge of Health, Welfare and Sport, but he believes that more ministries should commit themselves to people with disabilities. \\\"There are many ministries that still think 'that doesn't belong to us', but it belongs to all of us. It is in all kinds of areas of people's lives, so it is also in all kinds of ministries.\\\" Two million people The UN Convention on Disability entered into force in the Netherlands on July 14, 2016. Its purpose is to promote, protect and guarantee the human rights of people with disabilities. The aim should be to achieve as much independence as possible for people with disabilities. In addition, efforts must be made to make the threshold as low as possible to allow them to participate in society. There are approximately 2 million people with disabilities in our country. The UN Treaty Alliance believes that the agreements are being treated far too casually and attributes the deterioration to the decentralization of care. Without clear agreements, the obligations under the treaty have fallen to municipalities. In many cases, people with disabilities have difficulty accessing care and support and the government does not impose sanctions if people with disabilities are excluded. Since the UN treaty, two laws have been passed. One must guarantee equal treatment of people with a disability or chronic illness. The Electoral Act has also been amended. Since January 1 of this year, polling stations must be accessible to everyone. Three years ago, the UN Convention for People with Disabilities came into effect to improve their position. But, advocates argue today, the position of people with disabilities has actually deteriorated. \\\"I see that something is being tried, but to be honest, I don't notice that the government is super-actively committed to us,\\\" says Jiska Stad-Ogier. There are about 2 million people with disabilities in the Netherlands and she is one of them. Stad-Ogier has brain damage that means her muscles are not controlled properly. This makes walking difficult. Outdoors she is in a wheelchair, indoors she tires easily due to chronic pain. \\\"I have completely accepted that I have this disability. I am happy with my wheelchair because it gives me a lot of freedom. But the world is made for walking people,\\\" she says. The most important conclusion that five advocates draw today is that there is more attention for people with disabilities, but that this has not led to progress. Stad-Ogier also notices this. She actually needs an adapted home, but due to long waiting lists and complicated applications, she lives in a normal student house. \\\"This house is actually not suitable, because I cannot maneuver with my wheelchair.\\\" Her kitchen is also not allowed to be adapted, because she will have to leave once she graduates. \\\"A senior housing would be fine, but I don't qualify for that.\\\" She leaves the dishes to her husband. Just like cooking or any other form of housework: Even though she has become more mobile thanks to her wheelchair, she is still often limited by society. She describes an evening out with friends: \\\"We all went to a theater, but such a building was made with the idea of \\u200b\\u200b'a beautiful exterior and a chic staircase in front of the door'. Only then is it thought about that it should also be accessible for people in wheelchairs.\\\" As a result, Stad-Ogier has to rely on a side entrance and has to ring the bell to enter. \\\"The moment I step inside, I lose my friends.\\\" According to her, the UN treaty only works to a certain extent. Rules are now being imposed on the Netherlands, but whether you can actually participate as a disabled person also depends on other factors, she says. \\\"Like that one set of stairs or that side entrance.\\\" Many people with disabilities are unemployed and live in poverty. Stad-Ogier also sees a gloomy financial situation. \\\"There is now a proposal that I will be below the minimum wage, even though I have studied for years and have a lot of extra costs.\\\" Her home needs to be bigger because she has to live in it with her wheelchair, she has lost her deductible every year and she has all kinds of personal contributions, she lists. \\\"Life is more expensive but because I have a disability I am below the minimum wage.\\\" Stad-Ogier now has to rely on the help of her husband and friends, but she is afraid that this will cause her to become socially isolated. \\\"I've been asking them all kinds of things all day long and they also have to wait for me if, for example, I go through the other entrance.\\\" She's afraid that if she keeps asking, she won't have any friends left: \\\"It makes it so difficult for me to just be a good friend. To keep up socially.\\\" She hopes that agencies and policymakers will call on people with disabilities to think along more often. So that they can already see when designing laws and buildings what challenges people with disabilities face. \\\"I hope that I will soon be able to live my life the way I want, with a job that suits me. Instead of being held back by what the world arranges for me.\\\" The Eurovision Song Contest will only sell tickets by name and will randomly ask visitors for identification. Each buyer may also purchase a maximum of four cards. In this way, the organization hopes to take the wind out of the sails of black marketers. The capacity of the Eurovision Song Contest is limited. The final on Saturday evening, May 16 in Ahoy can be attended by 7,000 people. Two-thirds of those places go up for sale. The remainder is reserved for the delegations of the 41 participating countries and may partly return to the market. There are a total of nine shows for which people can purchase tickets. For each of the three live shows (the final and the two semi-finals) there is also a jury final and a dress rehearsal. Ticket prices range from 18.50 euros (semi-final family show, limited view) to 248.50 euros for the first ring during the live show. Tickets will also be raffled among Rotterdam residents with a low income. Ticket sales start on December 12. Reporter Martijn van der Zande, who follows the Eurovision Song Contest for the NOS, expects a run on tickets. \\\"In total there is room for 65,000 visitors, two-thirds of which are for the public. That's not much. I'm guessing that those tickets will sell out very quickly. I don't rule out that the fans will grumble about that.\\\" Yesterday it was announced that Edsilia Rombley, Chantal Janzen and Jan Smit will present the Eurovision Song Contest. \\\"It's the best job a presenter can get\\\": Hundreds of thousands of Dutch people celebrate Christmas Eve and words like 'Sinterklaas' and 'Piet' have been trending topics on social media all afternoon. It should be clear: it is December 5 and that means that presents are being handed out in a large part of the Netherlands. But that option does not apply to everyone. For families on or below the poverty line, Christmas Eve is far from a given. The Sintvoorieder1 foundation is committed to helping children from those families. Today, volunteers from the foundation crossed the area between The Hague and Rotterdam in six vans to deliver a total of around 10,000 gifts to children and young people up to the age of 18. \\\"We also call this Sinterklaas' secret warehouse,\\\" says chairman Esther Blom on NPO Radio 1. \\\"The children deserve it, they already miss so much because, for example, they grow up in poverty or under other difficult circumstances. That is why it is so important that we embrace and appreciate them. Everyone deserves a nice Sinterklaas present.\\\" For privacy reasons, the volunteers of Sintvoorieder1 do not deliver the thousands of gifts to the children and young people themselves. The packages go to organizations such as the Food Bank, the Salvation Army or the shelter. They spread them further. Every van is full to the brim, says Jacqueline van Halem of Sintvoorieder1. \\\"Each package also includes a bag of sweets. We can make a total of 10,000 families happy.\\\" Earlier this week, Van Halem received a nice response from a child who had received a gift through the foundation. \\\"He said: 'I have been nice this year.' That brought tears to my eyes. Last year this child had not received a Sinterklaas present. How wonderful it is to be able to take care of this.\\\" According to the Social and Cultural Planning Office (SCP), about 8.1 percent of children and young people under the age of 18 live in poverty. This concerns a total of 272,000 children. According to the SCP, children up to the age of 12 have an above-average risk of poverty: in 2017, almost 1 in 10 children under the age of 12 lived under the so-called 'not much but sufficient' budget. That budget includes both necessary expenses (on food, clothing and housing) and a minimum number of non-essential expenses (for example on a short holiday or a sports club). According to the SCP, this budget is still modest: luxury goods such as a car are missing. Parcels were also distributed in Groningen today to children from less fortunate families. Upper-level students at De Meerpaal, a school for special primary education, did not receive a Sinterklaas gift themselves, but bought presents for poor children from the neighborhood. \\\"That was very special for the children,\\\" says teacher Ri\\u00ebtte Tromp in the Jeugdjournaal. \\\"They really wanted the Sinterklaas celebration not only for rich children, but also for children who are poor.\\\" Student Gideon thinks it's a shame that he doesn't get a present at school himself. But he is happy that he could do something for other children. \\\"At my house we celebrate Sinterklaas every year, but the children don't because they don't have enough money for that.\\\" His classmate Chayenna agrees with him: \\\"Now those children have something more. I also wanted a present myself, but they are also very happy with it.\\\" Santa Claus visited many other primary schools in the country: Despite the economic growth in recent years, the number of people at risk of becoming poor has not decreased. Nearly 600,000 households had a low income and were at risk of poverty in 2018, according to a report by Statistics Netherlands. The group of households with a low income - less than 1060 euros for a single person, 2000 euros for a couple with two children - has become slightly smaller compared to the previous year, but is still larger than in 2016. This means that the number has already fluctuated by three between 570,000 and 600,000 households every year. Poor families in particular who have fled to the Netherlands in recent years are being left behind. Seven in ten families of Syrian descent are at risk of poverty due to low incomes; the same applies to more than 60 percent of Eritrean families. Syrian and Eritrean families have low incomes because it is difficult for them to find a job. Nine in ten of these refugee families live on social assistance benefits. According to Statistics Netherlands, the fact that the total group of households with a low income remains the same is partly due to the influx of refugees in recent years. For about a fifth of low-income families, the situation is not an immediate problem. They have sufficient savings to fall back on to meet basic needs. Nearly half a million families do not have that; their buffer is too small to absorb unexpected financial blows. According to Statistics Netherlands, this buffer amount for singles is 6,360 euros, for a couple with two children it is 12,000 euros. About 260,000 children grow up in a family at risk of poverty. Children from single-parent families are particularly at risk. Of all families with only a father or mother, a quarter had a low income. This means that the risk of poverty for children from a single-parent family is five times higher than for children growing up with two parents. The municipality with the most children in poverty is Rotterdam. 17.5 percent of all families with children there have a low income. That is more than twice as much as the national average. Rotterdam wants to reduce the fast food supply in the city. This is one of the measures in the Rotterdam prevention agreement to improve the health of residents. \\\"It is now easier to get a hamburger in the center than an apple,\\\" says Rotterdam councilor Sven de Langen (CDA). The municipality wants Rotterdam residents to \\\"really be able to choose from a varied food offering,\\\" the councilor writes in a letter. That is why it has been agreed with dozens of institutions to offer healthier food in hospitals, schools and community centers, among others. There should also be more water taps in the city as an alternative to sugary drinks. Half of Rotterdam residents are overweight, research shows. De Langen points to poverty in the city as the main reason for this. \\\"There are quite a lot of people who do not have the space, time and money to make healthy choices. Furthermore, life in the city itself is not always healthy.\\\" The number of fast food outlets in Rotterdam has increased significantly in recent years. The municipality is considering designating more areas where stalls are not allowed, to prevent new growth of fast food sellers. The municipality will also investigate whether the permit policy can stimulate the sale of healthier food. \\\"The commitment is more important than very concrete objectives,\\\" the councilor told RTV Rijnmond. \\u201cIf we can slow down obesity and reverse the increase, I would be very happy.\\u201d Rotterdam's plans are in line with the objectives of the National Prevention Agreement, with which the government wants to tackle smoking, obesity and alcohol abuse. The municipality has translated these goals into a local approach. Rotterdam, Amsterdam and Utrecht are jointly calling on State Secretary Blokhuis to introduce a sugar tax on soft drinks. They write this in an opinion piece in NRC. The first tickets for the live shows of the two semi-finals and the final of the Eurovision Song Contest sold out within twenty minutes. The almost 23,000 tickets that were made available today for the event in Ahoy in Rotterdam went on sale at 12 noon. According to the organization, at its peak, more than 80,000 people queued online to buy a ticket, on around 200,000 devices. A second round of sales will follow at the end of next month with fewer tickets than today. The last tickets will be available in March. About forty minutes after the tickets for the semi-finals and the final were sold out, the supply of tickets for the family shows also ran out. The second round of ticket sales for those performances will follow in January. In total there is room for around 65,000 people at the nine shows in Ahoy. Two-thirds of the places, more than 43,000 tickets, are for the general public. The rest of the places go to the delegations of the participating countries, officials and sponsors. The municipality of Rotterdam raffles a small portion of the cards among low-income residents. Ahoy can normally accommodate many more people. However, due to the decor and because the technology and the greenroom also have to be in the hall, there is less space for the audience. Henk Krol has been re-elected as party leader of 50Plus. This was announced at the party conference in Apeldoorn. The board had nominated 69-year-old Krol because he \\\"tirelessly stands up for the interests of the elderly in the Netherlands\\\". Krol was the only candidate, 89 percent of the members voted in favor of his appointment. \\u201cMaybe I will get a different nickname now: Kim Krol-il,\\u201d the party leader joked, referring to former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il. In his speech he looked back on the decade that the party has existed. \\\"Ten years ago: we were not predicted to have a long life. Eight years ago: many arguments. That image was created by us and confirmed by our opponents. Six years ago: all the topics of 50Plus were suddenly also discussed by other parties. And look, look in recent years... We count.\\\" After Krol's speech, a 'North Korean' video was shown: But it wasn't just about the past. For example, Krol spoke about pensions: \\\"We must no longer tolerate that they have not been indexed for 11 years.\\\" And it was about poverty and insecurity among the elderly: \\\"That has our absolute attention.\\\" And about age discrimination in the labor market: \\\"Not getting a job because you are over 45 is just as bad as not getting a job because you have a certain skin color.\\\" A striking initiative was also advocated at the meeting of the party that was founded for people over 50: The fact that he has been re-elected as party leader means that Krol will lead the list in the upcoming House of Representatives elections in March 2021. \\\"And we emphatically want to participate in government. We want to go to the room where the ministers meet.\\\" 50Plus has not yet had a party leader other than Krol. He led the House of Representatives elections in 2012 and 2017. The party currently has four seats in the House of Representatives. A poor Christmas threatens hundreds of households in Zutphen. The local food bank will close immediately because the building is unsafe and volunteers are no longer allowed to enter. There are cracks in the construction of the roof and that must be resolved first. Hundreds of households will therefore have to make do with smaller emergency packages this Christmas instead of the usual food packages. \\\"We look at what can be saved. We are not allowed to go much further than the door,\\\" Gert Vrieze told Omroep Gelderland. The chairman of the Zutphen Food Bank was unpleasantly surprised yesterday when it turned out that he was no longer allowed to attend the meal. According to Vrieze, it was possible to remove some non-perishable products from the building, but it was not possible to empty the freezers. \\\"We quickly ran out of space to store those frozen items, such as meat and ice cream and other non-perishable products. So they are still inside and there is little chance that they will be out before Christmas.\\\" We are working hard to have emergency packages ready in time. \\\"They will be less luxurious than intended, but better than nothing,\\\" says Vrieze. He can count on the support of food banks in the Zutphen area, which have already spontaneously arrived with supplies. A temporary location has also been made available to store these items and distribute the packages. About a hundred farmers in the Achterhoek have now offered help. \\\"The phone is ringing off the hook with companies that want to cooperate,\\\" says Jarno Meulenbeek, a dairy farmer from Wichmond. He has set up the alternative collection for the food bank. \\\"We are in discussions with companies that may want to make refrigerated trucks available so that we can properly store all fresh products.\\\" The farmers coordinate with the food bank when the food will be distributed to about 250 families from Zutphen, Lochem, Brummen and Eerbeek. In the Netherlands, almost 1 in 6 children grows up in a single-parent family. Twenty years ago this was still 1 in 9, according to figures from Statistics Netherlands. In total this concerns more than half a million children. A single-parent family arises because the partners separate or die. And sometimes a child's parents have never lived together. Babies are also increasingly living with one parent. In 1999, almost 6 percent of zero-year-olds grew up in a single-parent household. At the beginning of this year it was 9 percent (1 in 11). That amounts to 15,000 babies. The largest share of single-parent families can be found in Rotterdam, Amsterdam and Heerlen. In these three cities, more than a quarter of the children live with one of their parents. Staphorst and Urk had the smallest share of minors in a single-parent household at 4 percent, Statistics Netherlands notes. Children from single-parent families have a relatively high risk of poverty. Of all families with only a father or mother, a quarter had a low income in 2018. This means that the risk of poverty for children from a single-parent family is five times higher than for children growing up with two parents. The building of the Woudenberg Citizen Initiative Foundation was destroyed in a fierce fire last night. The building contained food and items that had been collected for people with low incomes. \\\"Tears come to your eyes,\\\" says Jacco van den Essenburg of the Woudenberg Citizen Initiative Foundation at RTV Utrecht. \\u201cIt is a catastrophe that we cannot feed our people now.\\u201d At the food and clothing bank in Woudenberg, food and supplies are collected for people who fall through the cracks. They have just too much income to qualify for the 'normal' food bank. They also do not meet the standards that apply to social assistance benefits. The foundation helps almost five hundred families in the region. The building that burned down last night contained clothing and food, as well as refrigerators and freezers. The foundation also collected laptops that children can use for school. Extra packages had been put together for families for the holidays, says Van den Essenburg. \\\"So that they had an egg for the holidays and an oliebol. It contained gifts for the children so that they could also say at school that they had received something for Christmas. There was also a nice gift in it for the adults. \\\" He hopes that companies and private individuals will take action. \\u201cHelp us with donations,\\u201d said Van den Essenburg. \\\"Take action! Then we can do our work again.\\\" The cause of the fire is unknown. The Woudenberg Food and Clothing Bank, which was left without shelter due to a fire this weekend, has found a new temporary building. Starting tomorrow, people can bring supplies and food there again. The building was completely destroyed by the fierce fire. The building contained food, clothing and other items collected for low-income people. \\\"Tears come to your eyes,\\\" said Jacco van den Essenburg of the Woudenberg Citizen Initiative Foundation yesterday at RTV Utrecht. \\u201cIt is a catastrophe that we cannot feed our people now.\\u201d People who go to the food and clothing bank have just too much income to qualify for the regular food bank. The foundation helps almost five hundred families in the region. In a Facebook message, everyone is thanked for the support after the fire. \\\"We are speechless at what this has achieved. We are very grateful.\\\" The cause of the fire is unknown. It is not clear how long the food and clothing bank can remain in the new building. The Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam will be illuminated tonight by thousands of lanterns, arranged in the shape of a heart. This is an annual campaign by the Dutch Cancer Society. Behind every lantern there is a different story: for a loved one who has or has had cancer, or someone who has died from the disease. Dozens of volunteers from the Dutch Cancer Society have been working on rebuilding the heart since Friday. People could donate a lantern with a handwritten name on it, and the donors were allowed to be present at the lighting moment. The money raised from the campaign will be used for cancer research. There are thousands of lanterns in the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam: Last year the lanterns were at Soestdijk Palace, previous years there were lighting moments at the Afsluitdijk and in a forest near Lunteren. The lanterns do not go into the air, but are planted in the ground. One of the lanterns burns for 19-year-old Nienke, who died three and a half years ago from cancer. Her parents Ruud and Carla are participating in the campaign for the third time, together with Nienke's twin sister. \\\"Our daughter died in 2016. She had two brain tumors. Nienke was extensively treated, irradiated and operated, but all to no avail,\\\" says father Ruud. The family takes every opportunity to put their daughter in the light. \\\"This KWF initiative is great. We get a lot out of it and I think that applies to more people. But the most important thing is that a lot of money is raised for cancer research.\\\" Valerie donated a lantern for her mother, who was diagnosed with breast cancer last February. She has been treated for the disease but still experiences many complaints. \\\"She actually got on with everything very quickly. She went at it like crazy. But those are pitfalls after you've had cancer. For example, now she has concentration problems and a lot of fatigue,\\\" says Valerie. According to Valerie, too little attention is paid to the 'battle' that ex-cancer patients have to fight after their illness, which, for example, involves psychological problems. \\\"When they have finished the treatment, they want to continue as quickly as possible and show that they can do it. Last December she became very tired and started working less. She now says that she feels much more of a patient than when she had cancer. You don't forget those words. Spontaneously doing something fun with her is no longer possible, everything has to be measured and planned. You don't just get that energy back, it takes years.\\\" According to Valerie, more attention should be paid to the problems after the illness. \\\"I think it is important that patients are made aware of the fact that they need to take it easy. This lantern campaign came across on Facebook and I thought: my mother deserves this. My mother is a heroine and I am proud of how she did it, despite all the setbacks, does. And I'm so happy she's still with us.\\\" This year, Revelina is donating a lantern to her brother-in-law Gilbert, who was diagnosed with prostate cancer two years ago. The disease has now spread to his spine. \\\"I hope he makes it to May 7, which is his birthday. He will then be 62 years old.\\\" Revelina also had to deal with the disease during her life. \\\"I had cervical cancer and have been clean for two years now. I am no longer under treatment, but since then I have always had the thought: would it come back? That fear remains and sits like a devil on my shoulder.\\\" In the past, Revelina has lost more loved ones to cancer, including her grandmother and step-grandfather. \\\"That was all a long time ago. Now they might have had a better chance of survival because research into cancer has already progressed much further. But more is needed. When you see what has to be done: it costs money and that is why these types of actions are very important.\\\"\",\n          \"Two originally Christian aid organizations are going to merge. The originally Protestant ICCO merges with the originally Catholic Cordaid. \\\"Scale increase is indispensable,\\\" says Cordaid director Kees Zevenbergen in Trouw. The merger will create an organization with a turnover of 200 to 250 million euros, with 5 to 10 million savings available on items such as computer systems and office spaces. According to the director, that money can be spent on combating poverty. With the merger, Cordaid hopes to increase its chances of financing from international funds. The aid organization will also focus on countries where help from vulnerable people \\\"really makes a difference\\\". That is why the organization is withdrawing from a number of regions and countries where ICCO is active, including South America and Indonesia. Cordaid previously reduced its operations from 46 to 10 countries. The two development organizations have had the same mission for decades, but worked side by side as a result of pillarization. For years, Christian organizations could count on a fixed amount of subsidy from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but for several years now the charities have had to compete with each other. Cordaid and ICCO therefore decided to investigate a merger last year. \\\"You can no longer make it on your own. If people of good will do not join forces, it is not enough. It is a shame when organizations compete against each other,\\\" Zevenbergen said in Trouw. The aid organization says it remains closely connected to the church and Christian values. There will be both a pastor and a priest on the supervisory board. Together they will bless a prayer room in the office building. Cordaid is currently the largest aid organization in the Netherlands after Doctors Without Borders. This will remain the case even after the merger. Minister De Jonge (Public Health) expects that around 15,000 vulnerable people will have been vaccinated with the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine next week. He wrote this in a letter to Parliament. The vaccination of residents of nursing homes and institutions for people with intellectual disabilities will start on Monday. In the following six weeks, about 140,000 residents of nursing homes and institutions must be vaccinated. De Jonge says that this means he is fulfilling the commitment to make the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine available to residents of nursing homes as soon as possible. For the time being, only healthcare workers have been vaccinated with the vaccine. In addition, the minister wants to vaccinate residents of smaller nursing homes and institutions for people with disabilities with the Moderna vaccine from January 25. General practitioners can administer these injections and can then immediately vaccinate themselves, writes De Jonge. But that is later than GPs had expected, the National Association of General Practitioners (LHV) writes in a press release. \\\"The minister is leaving general practitioners and therefore their patients out in the cold,\\\" says LHV chairman Ella Kalsbeek, who believes that De Jonge is not keeping his agreements. According to the minister's vaccination plan, all nursing home residents must be vaccinated by the beginning of March. In mid-February it will be the turn of people over 60 living at home. They will receive the Pfizer vaccine or the possibly approved vaccine from AstraZeneca. The Health Council had previously emphasized several times in recommendations that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines should mainly be used for the elderly. \\\"People aged 60 and over have the highest risk of severe illness and death from Covid-19. Moderna's vaccine shows very high efficacy in this group,\\\" the latest advice states. The Health Council called it \\\"an undesirable situation\\\" that only healthcare providers have been vaccinated so far. It means that there are fewer vaccines available for the elderly. De Jonge said yesterday at the press conference about the corona crisis that the aim is for all vulnerable people to be vaccinated before the start of spring. By autumn, the entire country must be protected against the virus: In his letter to the House, De Jonge further writes that 58,602 corona tests were taken last week, adding that this means that the capacity is only half used. \\\"That is why the government continues to call on everyone to get tested quickly.\\\" The reproduction number, or r-number, which indicates how quickly the spread is occurring, was estimated to be 0.95 on December 25. That is approximately the same value as a week earlier. \\\"That does not indicate a serious decrease in the virus spread,\\\" said De Jonge. It is estimated that more than a hundred thousand people in the Netherlands are infectious, or 1 in 124 people. We may soon also see more medical face masks on the streets, as is already the case in some parts of Germany. The National Aids Consortium (LCH) now has more than sufficient stock of personal protective equipment. That is why 2 million medical face masks were recently donated to food banks. The Poverty Fund and the Woudenberg Citizen Initiative Foundation will also receive 5 million in the near future, the letter states. He says he is \\\"not very patient\\\" by nature, but that and his military background have come in handy in some cases in recent years. Such as finding a solution for the canceled move of the marine barracks to Zeeland, and the renovation of the Binnenhof. \\\"I am a man who wants to speed up,\\\" says State Secretary Knops of the Interior in the NOS radio program Met het Oog op Morgen. He also understands that this sometimes meets with opposition. For example, he calls it \\\"very good\\\" that parliament has questions about the renovation of the Binnenhof. Not only because the renovation is architecturally complicated, but also because everyone has to move. \\\"But ultimately I am also a man of facts.\\\" And according to Knops, those facts are that moving during the renovation is the best option and that it costs the least tax money. The interview with Knops is the second in a series of interviews by Wilma Borgman and Wilfried de Jong with ministers and state secretaries of the Rutte III cabinet. The ministers look back on the cabinet period. The conversations are always broadcast on Saturdays in the program NOS Met het Oog op Morgen, from 11 p.m. on NPO Radio 1. Watch an excerpt here: What Knops is not yet satisfied with is the pace at which the reforms are taking shape on the Caribbean islands. . He had hoped they would be further along. The situations he sees there during working visits hit him hard. \\\"The conditions in which some children have to grow up, that deep poverty.\\\" Knops emphasizes that he and other ministers are not robots. \\\"We are people who try to make things better for others. No one in the cabinet is there just because it is so much fun. We are also busy because we all have a mission and have the feeling that we want to make things better.\\\" The - according to Knops inevitable - resignation of the cabinet yesterday does not change that. According to Knops, the outgoing cabinet will continue to combat the corona crisis. According to Knops, that feeling exists among the entire team. Knops saw his work - and not just his own - completely change last year due to corona: a few years ago no one would have thought of this scenario. \\\"The debates, consultations: everything is different now.\\\" As the person responsible within the cabinet for digital government, Knops also sees that many digital advances have been made this year. That may be a small positive effect, but the State Secretary also reflects on the suffering that corona has caused many people: having to sit at home, having no or less work, loneliness. Knops experiences that most of the things the government does during this crisis always receive support from the House, and he expects this will be no different in the coming months. \\\"Ultimately, a politician is just a passer-by,\\\" Knops says finally, to quote a statement by Mark Rutte. \\\"He once said: a politician should always have a travel bag ready. That's how it is.\\\" Much more money is needed to adapt countries and communities to the consequences of climate change. The amount that countries worldwide allocate for this will have to increase five to tenfold, to a maximum of 300 billion dollars. This is stated in the report State and Trends in Adaptation, which was published in the run-up to an international climate summit that the Netherlands is organizing next Monday. The report by the climate institute Global Center on Adaptation (GCA) expresses concern about the impact of the corona crisis on climate policy. \\u201cClimate change will not stop because of Covid-19, and neither should the urgent task of preparing humanity for life with the many consequences of a warming planet,\\u201d the report said. Because climate change is an \\\"even greater existential threat than Covid-19\\\". The GCA has been located in the Netherlands for several years. It signals that less money was allocated last year for what is called climate adaptation. This means: adapting to the consequences of climate change that will occur anyway, even if countries try to reduce their emissions. Last year, more than 50 million people were victims of a record number of weather extremes such as prolonged drought, storms or floods. Former UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon is involved in the GCA. At an online briefing for international media, he called on politicians to take more action. \\\"The climate is changing much faster and more dramatically than we thought. We are seeing severe forest fires, prolonged drought, heavy rainfall, melting ice in Antarctica and the Arctic, and we have no time to lose.\\\" Dozens of heads of state and government will participate online in the conference that the Netherlands is organizing on Monday. This is the first time that such a large climate adaptation summit has taken place. The aim is to exchange solutions to deal with extreme weather and sea level rise. In addition to government leaders and ministers, large companies and NGOs are also participating in the conference. Ban Ki-moon also said he is very concerned that the post-corona recovery plans will lead to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. \\u201cWe must remember: there is no vaccine to solve the climate problem.\\u201d According to director Patrick Verkooijen of the Global Center on Adaptation, it is important to make good use of the period after the corona crisis. \\u201cAs governments begin to invest trillions of dollars to recover from the pandemic, we have a unique opportunity to build a resilient and climate-resilient future, by integrating climate adaptation into fiscal stimulus and recovery plans.\\u201d Moreover, he says, the money for adaptation pays for itself in spades. \\u201cEvery dollar, pound, or euro invested in climate-resilient infrastructure, early warning systems for extreme weather, or restoring mangrove forests delivers a return on investment greater than the cost.\\u201d According to the new report, the most urgent challenge for the coming year lies in Africa. That continent has food supply problems south of the Sahara. As a result of extreme weather and locust plagues, malnutrition is most common here. More than 670 million people, or more than half of Africa's population, suffered from food insecurity last year. This means that they could not always count on sufficient healthy food. In addition to the publication of the new report, several thousand scientists are also calling on politicians today to take the climate more seriously. Throughout history, humans have always adapted to changing circumstances, they say. But the world is simply not yet sufficiently prepared for the climate impacts that will occur. They warn of growing poverty, water shortages and increased migration if too little action is taken. The scientists' statement, which also includes five Nobel Prize winners, is distributed by the University of Groningen. More than a million young people, from 115 countries, are also turning to politics. They believe there should be a 'decade of action' to tackle the cause of climate change and make the world more climate resilient. Young people in particular will be most affected by the consequences of climate change during their lives, they say. The gap between rich and poor has become even wider due to the corona crisis. This is the conclusion of Oxfam Novib in its annual report on economic inequality in the world. The richest thousand people in the world are back at the level they were before the corona crisis. But the poorest quarter of the world's population will probably need ten years to recover from the corona crisis. According to the report, extreme poverty is increasing again for the first time in ten years. \\\"Inequality has already increased alarmingly in recent years. Now you see that this has really accelerated enormously in the past year,\\\" says Michiel Servaes, director of Oxfam Novib. The ten richest people have become even richer since the outbreak of the coronavirus. Oxfam came to these conclusions by looking, among other things, at Forbes' list of the richest people in the world, data from the World Bank and a survey among 295 economists from 79 countries. According to Oxfam, inequality is not only growing between rich and poor. Women more often work on a daily wage basis or as temporary workers. \\\"If the economy threatens to collapse, in 70 percent of cases they are out before men,\\\" says Servaes. Because more women work in healthcare than men, they are also at greater risk of becoming infected, according to Oxfam. \\u201cThey are actually being hit double by this coronavirus.\\u201d According to Oxfam, the way in which vaccines are currently provided also leads to more inequality. \\\"Rich countries sometimes buy so many vaccines that they can vaccinate their own population 4 to 5 times over. As a result, poor countries are missing out,\\\" says Servaes. According to Oxfam, poorer countries will have to wait until 2023 before the population can be vaccinated. \\\"The longer it takes before your population is vaccinated, the deeper the economic crisis is and the longer it takes before you get back on the road to recovery,\\\" Servaes predicts. The report is published on the day that world leaders and executives meet digitally at the World Economic Forum. Every year this takes place in Davos in Switzerland, but this year the event is online. Oxfam hopes that the report will put the subject on the agenda. \\\"We have to look wider than just within the walls of the ICU.\\\" Intensivist Hugo Touw of the Radboudumc in Nijmegen has explained in the NOS Radio 1 Journaal his and three other intensivists' plea for relaxation of corona measures, even if that means that more people will die. Their appeal appeared yesterday in NRC. In the piece, Touw, Hans van der Hoeven and Alec Veenendaal, affiliated with the Radboud university medical center, and Nynke Postma of the Koningin Beatrix Regional Hospital in Winterswijk, wonder \\\"whether all the negative consequences of the measures are still in proportion to the intended health gain\\\" . According to them, the current measures are taking an increasingly higher toll. They mean delaying regular care, which sometimes causes premature death of people with cancer and people waiting for an organ transplant. \\\"We have previously advocated strict measures, and we are still in favor of them,\\\" Touw told NOS this morning. \\\"But we see the downside of those measures, which affects us.\\\" The foursome say they are now saving people who usually do not fully recover, for example because they have multiple chronic conditions such as diabetes, obesity or high blood pressure. They therefore believe that there should be a society-wide dialogue about a more selective admission policy in ICU wards. For example, by determining in advance what a person's chance of recovery or survival is and basing the choice on that. \\\"A devilish dilemma\\\", the doctors call it. \\u201cBut avoiding the conversation about this is harmful to both Covid patients and our society.\\u201d Since it appeared in the media yesterday afternoon, the foursome's argument has, in addition to criticism (\\\"the plea is contrary to medical ethics\\\"), also received a lot of support on social media. Twitter users call it \\\"a courageous speech\\\", praise the \\\"breaking of a taboo\\\" and say that \\\"the discussion has been avoided for far too long\\\" and \\\"it is good that the measures and dilemmas are being discussed in such a fundamental way\\\". \\\"The fact that we are thinking about this makes it clear how serious the situation is,\\\" said Touw. \\\"If we don't have this conversation, there will also be a lot of damage. We must take that into account and prevent it.\\\" By this damage they refer, among other things, to the disadvantages that students are experiencing, the many expected bankruptcies and the growing poverty among certain groups, which is widening the gap between rich and poor, the intensivists write. \\\"Current and future generations have to foot the bill for all the financial support packages that we are now concluding. And let's not even talk about future (financial) challenges, such as combating the climate crisis. All this has a strong negative impact on the health of our society as a whole.\\\" In a response to the NRC article, the Dutch Association for Intensive Care writes: \\\"The various sounds from the workplace reflect the medical dilemmas we face every day, such as whether the health benefits outweigh the package of measures to combat Covid-19. However, the choice and strategy to be followed is up to the cabinet, with substantiation from the various medical specialties and the relevant economic and educational sectors.\\\" \\\"Providing good care is more than controlling the capacity in the ICU. Now the choice falls on health,\\\" says Touw. \\\"We are not saying that all measures should be abolished. But because of the choices we make now, people are also dying. These are people at home, who do not have such a clear voice. We also want to draw attention to that.\\\" The intensive care doctors argue for relaxing measures \\\"that have a major impact on the well-being of our population and accepting that more people will die as a result of corona\\\". Exercising together and meeting each other outdoors, among other things, must become possible again, even if this means that more people will become infected. Ernst Kuipers responded to the call during his weekly press moment: \\\"Taking the fact that people die is a taboo. But in a crisis you have to make choices,\\\" says Touw. \\\"It is precisely because the crisis has lasted so long that we have to have this debate.\\\" \\\"It doesn't change the current message: we are very worried. We would prefer to help everyone. But we see that, while we try to help everyone, there is a group that we are not helping. That downside is becoming increasingly important. \\\" The Efteling Hotel is going to be renovated and all old furniture will be replaced. The hotel therefore decided to donate all the old furniture to a thrift store in Kaatsheuvel. And that suddenly generates a lot of attention for the thrift store. \\\"Everything was sold out in two days.\\\" This involved more than a thousand pieces of furniture from the hotel rooms, including beds, bedside tables, chairs, table lamps and tables. The thrift store is surprised by the success of the campaign. \\\"We are really overwhelmed,\\\" Henk van Komen told Omroep Brabant. \\\"We of course expected a lot of attention, but this much is very special.\\\" According to Komen, the complete sets were particularly popular: According to Komen, the furniture flew off the shelves. \\\"Everything was sold in two days. We can only be proud that we were allowed to have the items.\\\" Part of the proceeds goes to the thrift store, but a large part goes to the food bank in Loon op Zand. Albert Heijn's parent company, supermarket group Ahold Delhaize, has never achieved as much turnover as last year. Turnover amounted to 74.7 billion euros, almost 13 percent more than a year earlier. Profit did decline, from 1.8 to 1.4 billion. This is partly because the company has brought forward investments and 1.4 billion euros has been set aside to supplement pension pots. The company is benefiting from the lockdowns introduced in various countries last year. Restaurants, cafes and some shops had to close, causing consumers to go to the supermarket more often for their food. Ahold also owns the largest online store in the Netherlands: Bol.com. It was extra busy there, especially in the last months of 2020. In the last quarter, online sales increased by 70 percent. For the entire year, sales amounted to 4.3 billion, while the target was 3.5 billion. The target has been increased to 5 billion euros for next year. Earlier this year, Albert Heijn was accused of a lack of solidarity by the CEO of department store HEMA, Tjeerd Jegen. The HEMA stores have been closed for weeks due to the lockdown and Jegen accused Albert Heijn of stunting the sale of items that are usually not found in a supermarket. A campaign involving towels particularly bothered him. That action was canceled prematurely. The CEO of Ahold Delhaize, Frans Muller, says that many costs are also being incurred due to the corona crisis. According to him, almost 680 million euros have been spent on, among other things, hiring additional staff, safety measures and paying sick employees in the US. 21 million euros were donated to charities such as food banks and the Red Cross. The supermarket sector and online stores are sometimes called the winners of the crisis, but Muller disagrees. \\\"With our 7,000 stores, we are close to society and neighborhoods. We see how much pain there is for people and companies that have run into problems. We are not talking about winners, we have done our job.\\\" The idea has been put forward in the media that companies that benefit extra from the corona crisis should donate part of their profits to affected companies. Muller: \\\"I understand the social discussion. That is an issue for the next cabinet to discuss.\\\" The company does not dare to predict how high turnover will be in 2021. The uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus is too great for that, the company says. The supermarket group wants to further reduce costs in 2021. In 2020, costs were cut by 844 million euros. There will be an additional saving of 750 million euros in 2021. Cura\\u00e7ao starts vaccinations today, exactly one week after the first 19,000 Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines arrived from the Netherlands. The first injections have already been given on all other islands. At the official start, politicians and former prime ministers kick off the event. Then it is the turn of the 3,400 healthcare employees. Then the almost 40,000 elderly people on the island and people with a medical risk such as diabetics, overweight people and patients with cardiovascular diseases are eligible. For two groups in society it is still questionable whether they will also be vaccinated. The first group are people from surrounding countries who have fled to Cura\\u00e7ao and are staying there illegally. The second group consists of Dutch people who spend the winter on Cura\\u00e7ao and often have a second home here. These people bring in a lot of money as retirees, but are not registered in the population register. The group of foreigners includes approximately 17,000 Venezuelans who have fled their country for political or economic reasons and approximately 13,000 people from surrounding islands, such as Cuba, Haiti and Jamaica. These people have fled poverty in their own country and often work in garden cleaning or construction. In total, this concerns 30,000 people over whom the government has no insight. They can go to the Salu pa Tur clinic, Papiamentu for Health for Everyone, for their vaccination. The doctors there basically follow the GGD and first called up almost 200 people over the age of 60. The clinic's database contains only 3,000 undocumented migrants. The remaining 27,000 are being called on via Facebook and other social media to register to be vaccinated. Whether that will work remains to be seen. Most Venezuelans on the island are wary of the justice system, which ruthlessly sends every Venezuelan caught back to their own country. Human rights organizations even suspect Cura\\u00e7ao of sending back people who are unsure of their lives in Venezuela. Dutch snowbirds in Cura\\u00e7ao are often registered in the Netherlands and are therefore, like foreigners, out of the picture of the authorities. It is not yet clear whether they can get a shot. Many were turned away this week by employees of the telephone registration desk because they could not show a Cura\\u00e7ao identity document. They were promised last week that they could be vaccinated. Everything is not going smoothly yet. The registration line and the telephone helpdesk are difficult to reach and according to local media, the employees have not been properly instructed. That is extra painful for residents outside Willemstad. 60 percent of them do not have internet and rely on the telephone to make a vaccination appointment. Road builder Willem Kraan was one of the initiators of the February strike of 1941, exactly 80 years ago today. A wartime strike, aimed against the harsh actions of the German occupier against Jewish citizens. It was a courageous action, which Kraan and other strike leaders later had to pay for with their lives. The NOS broadcasts the commemoration '80 years after the February strike' on the Jonas Dani\\u00ebl Meijerplein in Amsterdam live at 4:30 PM on NPO 1 and NOS.nl. In addition to the wreath laying ceremony, Mayor Halsema, among others, will give a speech. Due to the corona measures, the commemoration is not open to the public. At 10.15 pm there will be a look back at NPO 2, with reports and various guests. On February 23, 1941, Kraan witnessed how German soldiers used brutal force to round up and deport about 400 Jews during the first major roundup in Amsterdam. He could not bear the injustice that he saw happening before his eyes. He visited his friend Piet Nak, who worked at the city cleaning service and, like Kraan, was a member of the underground communist party CPN. They decided to organize a strike, out of anger at what was being done to the Jews. The party agreed to this. The strike that followed on February 25 and 26 in Amsterdam and beyond was the only open and massive protest against the persecution of Jews in occupied Europe. Tens of thousands of people participated. In this video, Willem Kraan's granddaughter and great-granddaughter explain why the family does not consider him a hero. In the early morning of February 25, 1941, the tram drivers stopped work. It was quiet in Amsterdam, nowhere did the familiar ringing of the tram sound. Pamphlets were distributed everywhere with the call 'Cease! Cease! Cease!' Civil servants, cashiers, laborers, workmen; en masse people responded to that call. A day later, strikers also followed in Zaandam, Haarlem, Hilversum, Weesp and Utrecht. The German occupier had not expected such a massive strike. But on the second day, German soldiers intervened violently and the strike was ended by force. Nine people were killed, 24 seriously injured and numerous strikers were captured. Among the prisoners was also Piet Nak, who was severely beaten, but was miraculously released because the Germans did not know that he was one of the strike leaders. Nak survived the war. His friend Willem Kraan was eventually arrested on November 16, 1941 for his role in the strike and sentenced to death in the summer of 1942. Just before his execution, on November 19, 1942 at Soesterberg airport, 33-year-old Kraan wrote a moving farewell letter to his wife Bets and daughter Catrientje. He showed himself to be combative. \\\"I will be a Crane until the last second and I hope that all of you, especially you Bets, will live up to that name,\\\" he wrote. He also appealed to his wife to tell their young daughter later in life why he had died. \\\"And you probably do that, Bets, because otherwise she would still be ashamed of her daddy, and that is not necessary, because I am not a traitor, I fall for my ideal and I hope that this is not in vain.\\\" After Willem's death, Bets and Catrientje were left in great poverty. The grief over his death has left deep marks, even into the current generation. His family is proud of what he did, but the price was high. \\\"What if he hadn't done it?\\\" granddaughter Ellen Hettinga wonders. \\\"Then my grandmother probably could have had a normal family life.\\\" Willem Kraan was posthumously awarded the Yad Vashem award 'Righteous Among the Nations' in 1966 for his role in the February strike of 1941. More than 1,700 Dutch women are holding pharmaceutical company Bayer liable for physical damage caused by the sterilization agent Essure. They have united in the Essure Claims foundation and are working with health insurers CZ and VGZ. Essure consists of a flexible metal and plastic spring that is inserted to close the fallopian tubes. As a result, sperm cells can no longer reach the eggs. It was seen as an ideal solution for sterilization because it could be applied in the outpatient clinic within 10 minutes without anesthesia. In the Netherlands, the sterilization method has been used on approximately 30,000 women since 2003. Since then, part of that group has had complaints such as chronic fatigue, loss of concentration and perforation of the fallopian tubes, uterus and other organs. The Facebook group Essure Problems Netherlands now has about 4,000 members. \\u201cIt is known that thousands of women have suffered very serious physical and mental problems after implanting Essure,\\u201d said lawyer Antoinette Collignon, president of the foundation. \\\"In many cases, removal of the fallopian tubes and the uterus in which the feather was fused turned out to be the only remedy to relieve these complaints.\\\" According to her, the product has been surgically removed from approximately 3,000 women. \\\"We sent Bayer a letter on Friday in which we hold them responsible for the damage these women suffered. It was a minor procedure, but many women ultimately had to have surgery.\\\" Legal proceedings are not yet underway. \\\"We will first try to reach a settlement. First of all, we want Bayer to take responsibility and apologize,\\\" says Collignon. \\\"Of course this includes compensation and as far as we are concerned it is substantial. We cannot say exactly how much it is.\\\" The case of the Dutch women is supported by the international law firm PGMBM. If a settlement is reached, that office will receive up to a quarter of the proceeds. That support is necessary, says Collignon. \\\"Women are powerless against such a giant, they cannot finance such a case on their own. That is why we started looking for a litigation financier.\\\" The foundation draws hope from a similar case in the United States. Last year, Bayer settled for more than 1.3 billion euros with tens of thousands of women who had complained about health damage. The pharmaceutical company added that it does not mean that the company admits liability. A Bayer spokesperson says the company is aware of the letter. \\\"We are open to communication with the Essure Claims foundation,\\\" the pharmaceutical company responds. \\u201cBayer continues to stand behind the safety and efficacy of Essure, which is supported by data from scientific studies.\\u201d Essure was removed from the Dutch market in 2017, according to the pharmaceutical company because sales declined. After its introduction in 2003, doctors and patients quickly became enthusiastic about a new sterilization method for women. The Essure implant is relatively easy to insert and allows the fallopian tubes to close. \\\"A solution,\\\" says Karin (her full name is known to the editors), who chooses the method. Eighteen years later, 1,700 Dutch women hold manufacturer Bayer liable for physical damage caused by Essure. The implant consists of a flexible spring made of metal and plastic. Such a spring is inserted into both fallopian tubes. \\\"It is a sterilization method using an elegant technique that can be performed on an outpatient basis, without anesthesia, without a speculum,\\\" says a spokesperson for the Dutch Association for Obstetrics and Gynecology (NVOG). \\\"The sterilization was done using a viewer, which was inserted into the uterus through the vagina and cervix. The procedure usually took no longer than ten minutes.\\\" Also because women can resume their normal activities one day after the procedure and the method is very reliable after three months, Essure is quickly becoming popular among gynecologists and their patients. The method has been used on approximately 30,000 women in the Netherlands. Karin explicitly asked her doctor for Essure. \\\"I didn't have to go under anesthesia and it was a method without hormones - I thought that was very important, because I always react strongly to hormones. Everything I could find about Essure was positive. The springs were put in place in 2012.\\\" Karin is in her early forties at that time. A month after the procedure, she notices that her menstrual cycle is out of whack. Shortly afterwards she becomes increasingly hot and sweats a lot, she suffers from lower back pain and often feels tired. \\\"I thought: surely I shouldn't be in menopause? I couldn't get ahead of myself. I had had glandular fever before, I thought it had come back.\\\" A few years earlier, in 2008, Effi Sanders opted for sterilization with Essure. She was 34 at the time. \\\"It seemed so beautiful,\\\" but after a year she developed a series of vague complaints. \\\"I had a lot of headaches. During a dinner someone said to me: 'Whenever we are together, I see you taking paracetamol'.\\\" Sanders had almost continuous periods, had a lot of menstrual pain, was tired and grumpy. \\\"I also felt the springs. There was always a stabbing pain.\\\" Both women do not immediately make the link with the sterilization method. \\\"I could always come up with a reason for my complaints. I had small children, there was sometimes a lot of stress,\\\" says Karin. After a while, Sanders came across a Facebook group with women who suspected that they had complaints from Essure. Karin also joined the Facebook group after a broadcast of the television program Radar in early 2017. \\\"My complaints were similar to many of the complaints mentioned. After a few months I took action and was referred to a doctor.\\\" After waiting six to nine months - there is a long waiting list for Essure removal - both women undergo surgery. This means that the fallopian tubes are removed because the feathers are fused with them. \\\"I came out of the operating room and suddenly my head was clear. As if I had been underwater or in an airplane all that time. There was no more noise,\\\" says Sanders. \\\"After that I never had the pain I had before.\\\" Due to all the stress caused by the complaints, she is left with something else: Cushing's disease. Karin also does not escape unscathed. \\\"I went through menopause ten years before my mother. Essure was the catalyst.\\\" It is not known why some women developed (serious) complaints from the sterilization feather. \\\"There are still no scientifically proven causes for how the complaints are caused,\\\" says the NVOG spokesperson. \\\"Calcification of the sterilization feather is regularly observed, but that in itself is not an explanation.\\\" Bayer withdrew Essure from the Dutch market in 2017, according to the pharmaceutical company because sales declined. Gynecologists remove the feathers from all women who present with complaints, unless there are increased risks for such an operation. After much consideration, Karin joined the claim against the manufacturer, and Sanders is also participating. \\\"I don't want to be seen as pitiful, but Bayer must acknowledge that things did not go well here. I came out relatively well - others ended up in a wheelchair - but it did cause me a lot of misery.\\\" \\\"I participate to get satisfaction,\\\" says Karin. \\\"This has had such an influence on my life for six years. I have to do something about it.\\\" The new Housing Minister will probably heave a sigh of despair on his or her first day in office. On the desk is the folder 'tackling the housing shortage' and that can rightly be called a headache file. The file contains the housing shortage overview. This year there are approximately 300,000 home seekers and the shortage is increasing. Hardly anyone is surprised by a ten-year waiting list for an affordable rental home. And the average price of an owner-occupied home is approximately 400,000 euros. Parties no longer find the ongoing housing shortage acceptable, as is clear from the election manifestos. A \\\"silent disaster\\\", says D66, according to Forum for Democracy there is a \\\"housing crisis\\\" and many other parties talk about \\\"housing shortage\\\". They come up with all kinds of plans. Slide through the parties' plans here: At least 100,000 new homes must be built per year. One million new homes in the coming years. Mainly building for starters, students, people with a low income (social housing) and middle incomes. The parties therefore have no shortage of ambitions. The parties also largely agree on the cause of the failed \\\"build, build, build\\\" that the coalition insisted on for four years. Responsible D66 Minister Ollongren of the Interior talked her way through with all kinds of agencies involved. 'Housing agreements' were concluded, but the housing shortage continued to increase. Look at the numbers here; The problem is that the government is now hardly involved in housing construction. It is mainly up to construction companies, housing associations and investors to determine what they want to build. Municipalities and provinces determine where this should happen. All kinds of complicating (participation) procedures and time-consuming processing of building applications do not make it any easier. The creation of a new neighborhood can easily take ten years. In recent years, (foreign) investors have bought up properties on a large scale and rents have skyrocketed. The flow has also not started; It is difficult to find a smaller senior home for the elderly. Things have to change, says The Hague. First of all, with a new Minister for Housing, because that is what twelve of the incumbent parties want. The largest government party VVD does not like setting up new ministries, but does talk about \\\"more control in the distribution of scarce land\\\". And there is the crux. The government wants to regain control and no longer have to passively wait to see whether the correct permits are issued quickly at local or provincial level. The central government will certainly become more involved in the designation of construction locations in the coming cabinet period. Large-scale urban expansions will be examined in various places in the Netherlands, such as Almere Pampus, Valkenburg, Utrecht and Nijmegen (D66), Lelystad and Almere (Christian Union), Schiphol (Forum). The CDA is considering building a complete city, but does not yet have an exact location in mind. Furthermore, speculators will be dealt with more severely. The plans range from \\\"countering speculation\\\" (VVD) to introducing the Prince Bernhard tax (PvdA), whereby pawnbrokers with more than five houses have to pay more tax. Prince Bernhard is a cousin of King Willem-Alexander and is estimated to own around 600 properties in the Netherlands. The new cabinet will further try to adjust rental prices so that more expensive houses are more easily accessible for, for example, middle income earners. The development of small-scale senior housing will also be started, because this wish is reflected in all party programs. However, all these plans do not yet provide new accommodation in the short term. The Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency predicted this week that due to a shortage of building land and construction workers, the housing shortage will not disappear anytime soon. GroenLinks leader Klaver recently said bluntly in the NOS op 3 election program in response to a housing question from a young person: \\\"The very annoying answer is that you will not be able to buy a house in a year's time. The housing market has been completely ruined in the past ten years. The cabinet has come to see homes as a commodity.\\\" Some people are hoping for the quick conversion of vacant offices and flexible housing. Due to corona, more people will work from home and such a conversion of redundant offices is faster than the creation of a complete neighborhood. And a bright spot is the turnkey factory construction, where the parts only have to be put together on location. \\\"That goes faster than brick by brick,\\\" says D66. \\\"The new Minister of Housing can start immediately with flexible housing and factory and timber construction,\\\" says PvdA MP Nijboer.

The number of people visiting a food bank has increased significantly during the corona crisis. The volunteer organization helped 7.2 percent more people in 2020 than the year before. In total, the 172 food banks in the Netherlands assisted 160,500 people last year. In 2019 there were still 151,000. The largest increases were in Amsterdam and Rotterdam. The food bank expects the number of customers to increase further in the coming years. The organization takes into account an increase of 50 percent, writes Trouw. To help more people, food banks received four million euros in government support last year. In addition, the government pledged eight million euros from the European Social Fund. Until now, nothing could be done with that money because food banks work on the basis of donations from shops and catering establishments. In order to cope with the increasing demand in the future, food banks want to set up an independent foundation. In the event of an emergency, this foundation can then purchase food to help the poorest. You can argue with each other's ideas but still be friends. Or at least we can go through the same door together. That was the message of the six party leaders in the election debate of the NOS Jeugdjournaal. The broadcast was recorded yesterday and will be broadcast tonight. \\\"We often disagree, but in the end we like each other,\\\" says GroenLinks leader Jesse Klaver when asked by one of the children in the audience. Others agree, but D66 party leader Sigrid Kaag still gives the children a message. \\\"It's very healthy not to just have friends from work.\\\" Watch here how that conversation continued (and how the party leaders compared themselves during a quiz): The party leaders continued to talk about their wishes for the Netherlands, and especially for the next generation. \\\"We all want the best for the Netherlands in our own way,\\\" says PVV leader Wilders, who attaches the greatest importance to freedom. \\\"I hope that the Netherlands will remain a free country in the future.\\\" \\\"I think the most important thing is that I and all other politicians present the Netherlands to you just a little bit better,\\\" says CDA party leader Wopke Hoekstra. He further states that children should above all be able to use their talent. \\\"Someone who can calculate well might make that his job,\\\" said the outgoing Minister of Finance. Lillian Marijnissen (SP) and Sigrid Kaag (D66) both say that you should take good care of the earth. But they also give the children the spearhead of their party. \\\"Equal opportunities,\\\" says the SP leader. \\\"For example, poverty among children, we must tackle that.\\\" Kaag mentions \\\"good education\\\" and \\\"being who you want to be\\\". Jesse Klaver of GroenLinks calls tackling climate change \\\"the most important thing there is\\\". VVD leader Rutte also strives for a \\\"clean planet\\\", but he wants to tackle corona first. \\\"So you can go to grandma and grandpa.\\\" The election broadcast of the NOS Jeugdjournaal will be broadcast tonight at 7 p.m. on NPO 3. Due to corona, the main political stage is even more in The Hague than usual. How do voters far from the Hofstad view the campaign and how their interests are being served? The NOS discusses this in the three-part miniseries Ver van Den Haag. Today in Pekela. The East Groningen municipality of Pekela is more than 260 kilometers, or a three-hour drive, from the Binnenhof. A rural municipality of 12,000 inhabitants that had been shrinking for a long time, like so many of these places on the edges of the Netherlands. But in recent years that is no longer the case. There is now even new construction in Pekela. This region has traditionally been a deep red stronghold. It is not without reason that there is a statue of Fr\\u00e9 Meis, born here, a CPN MP and strike leader in the 1960s and 1970s, in the center of Oude Pekela. In the 1998 parliamentary elections, the PvdA still obtained half of the votes here. But four years ago the SP had to share the leading position with the PVV, which presents itself locally as \\\"the most reasonable PVV in the Netherlands\\\". This was the voting picture at those elections: How do residents of this municipality view the elections? Farmer's son Thijs Smit from Nieuwe Pekela can vote for the first time. He is taking his final pre-university education exams in nearby Stadskanaal. Thijs certainly wants to exercise his right today, just like most other 18-year-olds in his class, he says. Only, which party do you choose? Thijs is still undecided between two new ones: JA21 and the BoerBurgerBeweging (BBB). He believes that both parties seem to understand more about agriculture than the current cabinet. Because there is no subject where Thijs feels so emphatically the great distance from politics in The Hague. \\\"Just those endless rules that farming has to deal with! And they are often mutually contradictory.\\\" It is about his future, because Thijs would like to take over his father's company after completing agricultural college. Together they protested against the nitrogen policy at the provincial government building in Groningen in October 2019. \\\"Those demonstrations certainly did not change everything, but I think they did create awareness elsewhere in the country that there is a problem.\\\" The point is, Thijs thinks, that most politicians simply don't know farmers. \\\"There are only two in my class. But we all talk to each other and that means the others have the necessary knowledge and understanding.\\\" After his retirement in the summer of 2017, the divorced Wybe Vermeij (68) moved from Almere to a mansion that is more than a century old on the Pekelderdiep. The type of property that would be financially unfeasible in the Randstad in the current housing crisis, but is still very affordable in Oude Pekela. There are more new residents of Pekelen who benefit from the low house prices in East Groningen: a family from Alkmaar lives nearby. Vermeij likes it: \\\"The people here are also nice and direct, just like I was used to.\\\" The disadvantage is that Vermeij now sees his children less often due to the great physical distance. Especially during corona times. He has been a PvdA member all his life, albeit with a liberal slant: \\\"I'm allowed to do a lot.\\\" He is very fond of the principle that the strongest shoulders should bear the heaviest burdens. In that respect too, he fits well in Pekela, which was declared 'the most social municipality in the Netherlands' by the FNV and has an active poverty policy. Does he have any idea why the VVD appears to be the largest again in these elections according to the polls? \\\"Well, if the VVD wants to increase the minimum wage... That of course takes the wind out of the left's sails a bit.\\\" Margaret Kaaijk (63) lives with her husband and four Hungarian sheepdogs by the canal in Nieuwe Pekela. She voted for Forum for Democracy two years ago, during the Provincial Council elections. But not anymore, Thierry Baudet has started behaving \\\"too strangely\\\", she says. Instead it will now be the PVV. More precisely, she is voting today for one of the PVV members who are extra committed to animal rights. Dion Graus, or number 21 on the list Chris Jansen. \\\"As a member of Parliament in Flevoland, he fights against the terrible things happening to the large grazers in the Oostvaardersplassen.\\\" She was not surprised that so many Pekelders opted for the PVV in the previous parliamentary elections. \\\"In the past, people often voted communist in this region, which was in fact already a protest vote. And little has changed in the meantime; there is a strong feeling here that East Groningen will always remain a province. In previous centuries, there was great peat was cut on a large scale, later the rest of the country benefited from Groningen gas with all the consequences that entailed. And now you see wind turbines and solar parks everywhere in the area. Especially here, much more than in the west.\\\" Vaccinations have greatly improved public health. Diseases that claimed countless lives every year worldwide have now been almost or completely eradicated. Thanks to vaccines. And now, in the corona pandemic, the world is pinning hope on vaccinations as a way out of the crisis. It is the message of the book Vaxx - How vaccinations have made our world better, in which physician-microbiologist and epidemiologist Roel Coutinho outlines the history of vaccinations against serious infectious diseases. The book is also Coutinho's response to the anti-vax movement, which he encountered harshly as director of the Center for Infectious Disease Control at the RIVM. That introduction was in 2008, when the vaccine against the HPV virus, which can cause cervical cancer, was included in the National Vaccination Program (RVP). The information about the HPV vaccination was traditional: with leaflets, advertisements and commercials. The internet was ignored. But that is precisely where the target group of young girls met and fables were spread about the alleged harmful effects of the vaccine. And according to Coutinho, the media gave a lot of space to people who called the vaccines poison without any evidence. An article in the Dutch Journal of Medicine in which several cancer epidemiologists spoke out against the rapid introduction of the HPV vaccination did not help either. Only 50 percent of the invited girls came to get the HPV vaccination that first time. Roel Coutinho acknowledged to the NOS at the time that the campaign for the HPV vaccination had failed. Since then, RIVM has been actively involved in internet discussions. In a so-called Cochrane review in which all available studies are assessed, it has again been shown that the HPV vaccines protect young women against precancerous conditions of cervical cancer. There are no indications that they are not safe. During a debate about the Mexican flu in Amsterdam in early 2011, Coutinho again had to deal with anti-vaxers. He needed protection to avoid being hit. Ultimately he had to leave through the back door. Whatever anti-vaxers claim, vaccinations have greatly improved the health of the world's population, Coutinho emphasizes in his book. Polio (infantile paralysis), for example, has been virtually eradicated worldwide. The polio virus causes an intestinal infection that babies usually get. They were still protected by antibodies that their mother had passed on. Due to improvements in hygiene from around 1850, the number of polio cases decreased. If they did occur, it was at a later age, when the mother's antibodies had worn off. As a result, infections became more serious and regularly caused (child) paralysis. In the early 1950s there was a vaccine against polio that was offered in the Netherlands from 1957. After that, polio outbreaks only occurred among experimental Reformed people: in 1971 in Staphorst and in 1977 in Elspeet and Uddel. The latter outbreak swept through the entire Bible Belt and affected an estimated 20,000 people. 110 became seriously ill and 80 became paralyzed. Even in areas controlled by the Taliban or similar fundamentalist Muslim groups, polio has not yet disappeared. These groups prevent the vaccination of the population for religious reasons and by force. Another success that Coutinho mentions - in addition to the vaccinations against diphtheria and tetanus, for example - is the MMR vaccination against mumps, measles and rubella. Meningitis is the most serious complication of mumps. In men, the testicles can become infected, which can lead to sperm abnormalities. There is insufficient evidence that mumps can make men infertile. Rubella is especially dangerous for pregnant women. The most famous example of this was Princess Christina. She was born with an eye defect because her mother Juliana became infected with rubella during pregnancy. Measles can cause (serious) complications such as middle ear infection, pneumonia and meningitis. The vaccines against mumps, measles and rubella have been around for about sixty years and have been included in the National Vaccination Program since the second half of the 1970s. Since then, these diseases in the Netherlands only occur in groups that refuse vaccinations. The three vaccines have been given in combination since 1987, the MMR injection. The vaccination rate must be at least 95 percent for measles, which is extremely contagious, to achieve herd immunity. Due to a publication in 1998 by the English doctor Wakefield in The Lancet, the vaccination rate fell in many countries. Wakefield made a connection between the MMR vaccination and autism and intestinal complaints. But Wakefield turned out to be a fraud, his article was retracted by The Lancet and he was struck off as a doctor. Nowadays he opposes corona vaccines from the United States. With little success, interest in vaccinations against SARS-CoV-2 seems to be high in most places. Even before his own birth, serious infectious diseases crossed Roel Coutinho's path. His Jewish parents had to report for deportation to Poland in 1942. At that time they had the highly contagious disease paratyphoid and were given a four-week postponement. They went into hiding just before they passed. In 1946 their son was born, who would grow up to become a leading infectious disease specialist. People with a low income are at greater risk of dying from corona. The chance of dying from Covid-19 was twice as high for the poorest 20 percent of Dutch people, who did not receive (home or long-term) care, as for the richest 20 percent, according to new figures from the Central Bureau for Statistics. CBS, together with the Amsterdam UMC, analyzed the death rates during the first wave of the corona pandemic, from March to July last year. During that first wave, a total of 10,067 residents of the Netherlands died who had been diagnosed with Covid-19 or were highly suspected. The researchers wanted to know whether the disease hit harder among certain population groups, such as non-Western migrants and people with a low income. It is striking that the effect of income differences is particularly large among people under the age of 70. The chance of dying from Covid-19 at that age was almost three times as high in the lowest as in the highest income group. For people over 70, the risk was almost twice as high. Working from home is not possible. The researchers look for the explanation in the more cramped housing in which people over 70 live and their working conditions. This means that people are more at risk of becoming infected. \\\"It could be that people with a low income are more likely to work in sectors where it is not possible to work from home or to properly comply with the corona advice at work,\\\" the researchers write. It also applies to other diseases that people with lower incomes are more likely to die from them. Previous research shows that mortality can be partly explained by an unhealthy lifestyle, such as smoking and being overweight. Non-Western migrants Dutch people with a migration background had a slightly higher risk of dying from Covid-19 in the period from March to June. This was especially true for people with a non-Western migration background. During the last weeks of the first wave, the risk of death for people with a non-Western migration background was one and a half times higher than for people of Dutch descent. Not all migrant groups were hit equally hard. The mortality risk was higher among people with a Turkish or Surinamese background than among people with a Moroccan or Antillean background. That could have to do with underlying suffering. \\\"Conditions such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease are more common among people from some origin groups,\\\" the researchers say. \\\"These are conditions in which an infection is more likely to end seriously.\\\" The differences were not the same in all regions. Their mortality risk was especially increased in the regions of Amsterdam, The Hague and Rotterdam. This did not apply to the south of the country, where the outbreak first occurred. Corona affected everyone there, regardless of migration background. How the mortality risk has developed after the first wave remains to be further investigated. Living on the living allowance left over from social assistance benefits for a month. Tilburg councilor Esmah Lahlah tried this last month to experience what people on social assistance face. She had 250 euros to make purchases: \\\"Forty euros per week for myself and ten euros extra per child, according to the Nibud standard.\\\" She found it a tough and tough month, she says in the NOS Radio 1 Journaal. \\\"I lived on a bag of paprika chips for a number of days. You constantly have to make choices, but you don't actually have those choices. Healthy food, fresh vegetables and fruit are extremely expensive. Unhealthy food is cheaper. That's why it's easier to buy a bag of frozen fries from less than a euro than fresh potatoes. 41-year-old Lahlah has been the councilor responsible for the Participation Act and social assistance for the municipality of Tilburg for three years. About 7,000 families in the municipality receive social assistance benefits. The Participation Act does not work as a safety net, nor does it as a springboard to participate in society, Lahlah concludes. For this reason, Tilburg decided last year to deal differently with families on welfare and not to focus blindly on the outflow to work, as required by the Participation Act. \\\"We try to to offer families more tailor-made solutions and to approach them from a place of trust, not distrust.\\\" Lahlah experienced that this does not work that way in practice from the moment she applied for benefits. \\\"I was called for a reporting meeting. That sounds quite threatening. Why don't we call it an introductory meeting?\\\" The large number of forms she had to fill in, including for benefits, the food bank and education fees, and the constant retelling of her story, made \\\" that she could no longer see the forest for the trees.\\\" With a lot of trial and error, Lahlah managed to survive on her tight budget until the end of the month, despite setbacks such as the MOT inspection (50 euros) and a defective coffee maker. Her two teenagers had to go a month without pocket money, gym, Netflix and new clothes. \\\"It's more about surviving than living.\\\" She still had five cents left for the last days: Lahlah hopes to use the experience gained to improve policy, both in her municipality and in the discussions with the government about the Participation Act. Because adjustments are needed in both the organization of assistance and in legislation and regulations, says the councilor. \\u201cAssistance must be increased and we must get rid of a law that is coercive and controlling, including forms full of legal language and a controlling tone, and move towards more human contact,\\u201d she says in Trouw. \\\"This way you also get more insight into what someone can do rather than not.\\\" This should ultimately lead to real participation from everyone, Lahlah hopes. \\\"Everyone should be able to be independent and have perspective. Everyone should be able to participate in society and experience well-being. And get help if that doesn't work.\\\" The economy will recover more strongly from the corona pandemic than was expected at the beginning of this year. The IMF (International Monetary Fund) has increased its growth forecasts for the world economy for this year from 5.5 to 6 percent. For next year, growth of 4.4 percent is expected. Despite the high degree of uncertainty about the further course of the pandemic, the way out of the health and economic crisis is clearly visible, helped by mass vaccination in many countries and the support of governments. However, the virus has not yet been defeated: the number of infections is still rising in many countries. There are also major differences between countries, which arise from the speed at which the population is vaccinated, the level of government support and the importance of tourism for a country. The massive support from central banks and governments, together accounting for some $16 trillion in fiscal and financial terms, has saved the global economy from worse. The IMF believes that without that help the crisis would have been three times worse. Not all countries can afford strong government support, some are struggling with high debts and are therefore struggling to overcome the crisis. The large and developed economies, such as China, the US and the euro countries, have all returned to pre-corona levels this year, with China in the lead. In many other countries, however, things are a lot more difficult due to a sharper economic contraction and inept recovery. That leads to more inequality. The loss of national income varies considerably. For developed countries, the average income decline is 2.3 percent, in emerging economies it is 4.7 percent, so double, and in poor developing countries even 5.7 percent. Due to these types of heavy economic losses, poverty is increasing again and 95 million people are again experiencing extreme poverty, the IMF believes. The crisis mainly affects young people, poorly educated people and women. The corona crisis has accelerated digitalization and automation in the economy, costing many jobs. Many jobs will not return and other work often leads to lower wages and therefore less income. The IMF has also adjusted its forecasts for the Netherlands. Compared to the estimates of the Central Planning Bureau (CPB) last week, it is striking that the IMF is more positive for this year and slightly more gloomy for 2021: The government must do more to combat unhealthy eating behavior and promote healthy choices. The Council for Public Health and Society (RVS) advocates this in a report. The advisory body wants a ban on advertising for unhealthy food. The council also proposes reducing VAT on healthy food such as fruit and vegetables and introducing a sugar tax. Municipalities should be given the authority to ban fast-food restaurants and snack bars to promote a healthier living environment. To tackle health backlogs, an investment of 2 percent of the Ministry of Health's budget would already provide a good starting budget, the council states. That equals more than 1.7 billion euros. But according to the council, it should not be limited to a financial investment. The RVS wants there to be a legal obligation to reduce health inequalities. A lower limit should be established in the health field. \\\"Comparable to the lower limit for social security: the subsistence minimum,\\\" the report states. Health inequalities are related to other social problems, such as unemployment, low income, debt and an unhealthy living environment. Dutch people with a vulnerable social position (low income and practical education) live on average seven years shorter than people with a theoretical education and a high income. They also live an average of fifteen years shorter in good health. The corona crisis has further magnified the persistent problems, the council concludes. The RVS therefore advises the Ministry of Health to arrive at a joint approach in collaboration with relevant ministries and to implement this policy for at least fifteen years. \\\"Certainly because some causes of disadvantage are passed on from generation to generation. This applies in particular to poverty, debt and insecurity,\\\" the council said. The way in which the Netherlands deals with migrants and asylum seekers is similar to the treatment of the victims of the childcare allowance affair. That's what migration law experts say. Migrants and asylum seekers are also victims of government distrust and rigid measures, lawyers and researchers say in a joint appeal today. They present a study and fifty bundled negative experiences with the title Unheard of injustice in immigration law, referring to the final report Unknown injustice of the parliamentary inquiry committee into the childcare allowance. It was drawn up by the Center for Migration Law of Radboud University in Nijmegen and the professional associations of migration and asylum lawyers. The migration experts mainly focus on the IND implementation agency, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, but also on the administrative law department of the Council of State. As the highest court, it must make the final judgment on decisions of the IND. And, the experts say, far too little of this is done with a human touch. There are many similarities between those involved in the benefits affair and the group they are targeting, the experts note. Just as in the benefits affair, these people also often have a low income. They usually do not have Dutch nationality and access to justice is difficult for them. The government's distrust in these people is far too great and has far-reaching consequences, say the authors of the report. \\\"From entry into the Netherlands up to and including naturalization, the government distrusts the migrant and there is only limited judicial control over that distrustful government. In immigration cases, this leads to injustice that is not sufficiently recognized,\\\" the experts said. They accuse the IND of treating migrants with a residence permit as fraudsters when they submit incorrect or incomplete information. The judges go along far too much with this, they say. Special circumstances only count in the weighing of interests in very exceptional cases. For example, living with someone who is staying illegally in the Netherlands has major financial consequences. Such a person then loses the right to benefits for, for example, care and rent. The Ombudsman for Children had previously drawn attention to this. She expressed her concerns about the position of the hundreds of (Dutch) children of whom one parent is not legally resident. In such a case, the entire family is no longer entitled to benefits and the child-related budget. According to the Ombudsman for Children, this leads to dire situations of poverty. As an example, she gave the Dutch Israel that got into financial problems because her benefits were stopped because her partner was not allowed to live in the Netherlands. Her job, with which she supported her four children and her partner, did not provide sufficient space to solve the problems, let alone to finance legal assistance for these problems. To avoid eviction, a divorce seemed the only solution to her. It is just one of the examples that migration law experts point out. The rigid attitude towards deporting asylum seekers who are already registered in another country is also a thorn in their side. Hardly any account is taken of the asylum applicant's family already present in the Netherlands. They must then return at all costs to the country where they first entered Europe. The report will be handed over today to four former lawyers who have now been elected to the House of Representatives and to Bart Jan van Ettekoven of the Council of State. The chairman of the administrative law department said that after the harsh conclusions of the House committee in the benefits affair - also about the council's actions - he wanted to learn lessons from the affair. He then announced a 'scan' on previous statements, which also involved tough legislation. \\\"We are going to examine our entire cabinet of cases and rulings. We want to see whether there are disproportionate consequences for citizens in other areas, even though the law requires the judge to take strict action,\\\" Van Ettekoven said at the time. . It is a well-known problem surrounding migrant workers in the EU: exploitation, intimidation and poor living conditions. A national approach to these problems is still pending, so Rotterdam itself is coming up with an action plan to improve the living conditions of the migrants. \\\"I see more and more people from Eastern Europe without work, camping in tents between the bushes of the Zuiderpark, sleeping in basement boxes of porch houses in neighborhoods that are already struggling with high unemployment and poverty. I don't want these kinds of degrading situations in my city. \\\" says PvdA councilor Richard Moti (Work, Income and EU Migrants). Today he presented his action plan. The municipality wants to better protect EU migrant workers in the future by, among other things, better registering them, making informal contact and extra hunting for slum landlords. Former SP leader Emile Roemer and his Support Team for the Protection of Migrant Workers produced a report at the end of 2020 on the living and working conditions of migrant workers. It contained fifty recommendations to improve the situation. But improvements from the central government are taking a long time. In the meantime, municipalities are sometimes faced with dire situations. At the trade union FNV they also notice that municipalities do not know how to tackle the problems with EU migrant workers themselves, without the central government: \\\"Municipalities regularly come to us with questions. Sometimes these are simply questions such as what do migrant workers themselves think about it? and what do they need,\\\" says Bart Plaatje of FNV. According to Plaatje, expertise is often lacking: \\\"Municipalities often think that they cannot do anything about it if ten people live in a house where they are not registered, but that is certainly possible.\\\" According to the Rotterdam councilor, it takes too long before anything happens nationally. \\\"Worker migrants now seem to be second-class citizens, while they deserve the same appreciation as everyone who works in the Netherlands. This is also the core of the report of the Boosting Team for the Protection of Labor Migrants by Emile Roemer, which makes important recommendations. Recommendations, which in addition to reflection on our norms and values , mainly asking for stricter legislation and regulations. Yet it remains eerily quiet from the cabinet,\\\" says Moti. And so the municipality itself is taking the lead by freeing up several million for an integrated action program. One of the points in the Rotterdam action plan is registering people in the Municipal Personal Records Database (BRP). This registration is not mandatory and it is therefore unknown where many EU migrant workers live in the Netherlands. A change in the law is required to make such registration mandatory. But Rotterdam is already working on it: \\\"When we come into contact with people, for example when they visit because of a report of nuisance, we encourage them to register anyway, so that they also build up rights. We also look for contact with schools attended by children of migrant workers whose parents are not registered,\\\" says Moti. The municipality also wants to hold more walk-in consultation hours where people can easily ask for information. A scout has been appointed who will look at how rogue employment agencies can be tackled to combat exploitation. And the municipality is looking for ambassadors in the community who want to be a link between migrant workers and the municipality. The program focuses on four neighborhoods in Rotterdam where most migrant workers live. The councilor hopes to be able to make a difference in this way: \\\"I have resolved to do everything within my power to tackle these abuses within my municipality. We will push the boundaries and, above all, see what is possible.\\\" The ministry announced that it was not yet able to respond to the Rotterdam plans. Today is the first day of Ramadan, a period when Muslim families visit each other to break the fast with the iftar meal after sunset. Due to the corona measures and the curfew, Ramadan is different than normal. Numerous initiatives respond to the restrictions. In the Tevhit Mosque in Venlo, the Quran is normally read from beginning to end in the mosque during the fasting period, a number of pages per day. Now this happens online, says Hakan Tasdemir, secretary of the mosque's board. \\\"In this way we try to create that atmosphere of Ramadan, of being together. But just in a different way.\\\" The mosque also tries to create an atmosphere of togetherness during iftar. \\\"Normally we often all eat together in the mosque. People then give a donation in the form of money or food to pay for those meals.\\\" This year, members of the mosque are cooking a hot meal for the food bank in Venlo. Anyone, including non-Muslims, can pick up a meal there, says Tasdemir. \\\"And people who have to eat alone at home during iftar give you the feeling that someone is eating with them, because we all eat the same thing on that day.\\\" Tasdemir hopes that this way the feeling of togetherness can be created. At this mosque in Amsterdam, Mohammed prepares meal packages, especially for Ramadan: Ramadan is of course not just about food, says Tasdemir. Members of the mosque also visit the weak and elderly in the neighborhood to ask if they need help. \\\"Loneliness is somewhat of a disease of the 21st century, which is especially visible during corona.\\\" \\\"And initially, Ramadan is about self-control, self-reflection and thinking about your fellow man. The realization that you need each other and moving away from individualism are topics that are highlighted during Ramadan.\\\" It is precisely these topics that have also come to the fore during the corona pandemic, says Tasdemir. \\\"Cruijff said before: 'Every disadvantage has its advantage'. You can also see this in these times: corona has made us realize that we can only get out of the pandemic together. It forces us to work together. That is also where the Ramadan is all about.\\\" For Amsterdam aid worker Said Bensellam, it takes some getting used to, the first day of fasting until sunset. \\\"Don't drink coffee, you know the drill.\\\" Not surprising, because his alternative food bank in Bos en Lommer is busy. Bensellam runs a drive-thru where agencies and people in need can pick up food for iftar meals. In an app group, initiators in the neighborhoods are informed about what food is coming in. \\\"Then they can pick up what they need to make meals for Ramadan.\\\" It became clear last year that Bensellam did not miss his target. \\\"15,500 meals were given away. People now know where to find us.\\\" Non-Muslims can also go to the collection point. \\\"During Ramadan it's about helping those in need. Anyone who needs help is more than welcome.\\\" Campaigns are also being set up on social media for the Ramadan period. Such as Ramadan with Marwa, from Facebook group Marwa Juice. Manager Marwa, who prefers to keep her surname private, drives across the country for this purpose. People who want to help and people who need help can register. \\\"What is donated can be anything: food parcels, but also clothing and furniture. People register throughout the Netherlands. I have created an Instagram account for this, where people can send me a DM. We have now received 200 requests and We work together with an organization that makes food parcels for us.\\\" It is the second year for Ramadan with Marwa. \\\"Last year was the first Ramadan during corona times. I sat on the couch with a friend and said I wanted to help people.\\\" It soon became apparent that there were enough requests from people who could use help. Marwa then decided to visit those people together with a friend. \\\"We first started in Utrecht, but that soon expanded to the whole of the Netherlands. Ultimately we helped 500 families.\\\" Marwa lets her feelings determine who qualifies for help. \\\"I work from my heart. If I receive a message from someone, I offer help. It has happened that I delivered a food package to someone and three other packages had already been delivered, but that does not mean that those people didn't need it.\\\" The success of last year also came as a surprise. \\\"My girlfriend and I were very busy. We were still on the road after sunset and had to eat something in the car. Sometimes I didn't get home until 1 or 2 o'clock at night.\\\" However, not much will change in the design of the initiative this year, although the curfew does pose a new obstacle. \\\"Many people are open to helping, maybe we can overcome it this way. I don't think I can get a work statement for this, unfortunately.\\\" Marwa is not yet looking ahead to how she will celebrate Eid-al-Fitr, the second edition in corona times. \\\"In any case, I am very busy now with Ramadan with Marwa, and I am thinking of doing something special for Eid-al-Fitr. I also very much hope that the corona measures will have been relaxed by then, so that we can celebrate it as it should be.\\\" The last tickets for the 538th Oranjedag on April 24 in Breda have been auctioned for thousands of euros. A regular ticket costs 37 euros, but according to Omroep Brabant, sometimes up to 15,000 euros have been offered. For that amount, two people get access to the party. The entire proceeds from the auction will be donated to the food bank, organizer Radio 538 reports. 538 Orange Day is one of the so-called field lab events, where researchers look at how events can be held safely. The party will be held at the Chass\\u00e9veld in Breda. All visitors, employees and other involved parties must undergo a rapid test in advance. The event, the largest field lab event to date with 10,000 visitors, was already sold out at the radio station yesterday. More than a million tickets had been requested. The tickets were distributed by lottery. The last tickets were offered today on Vakantieveilingen.nl. Radio 538 warns of scammers offering tickets for the party. \\\"Because our tickets are personalized and therefore non-transferable, we actively warn all Oranje fans via Radio 538 and our social media channels about scammers.\\\" Local catering entrepreneurs reacted indignantly to the plans for the event, because the catering industry must remain closed. Breda Mayor Paul Depla said he understands the catering industry in his city. He said he wanted to discuss with Radio 538 whether there was a role for the catering industry in the event. Members of the Outbreak Management Team and virologists have criticized the large number of testing events. Given the number of infections and hospital admissions, they believe the tests with large-scale events radiate too much optimism, while they believe there is no reason for this. Food bank West Friesland is temporarily closed due to an out of control mouse plague in the distribution center and point in Hoorn. This is done in consultation with the Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority. \\\"Our mouse control plan worked well for years, but now it was no longer successful,\\\" says Leoni Sipkes, chairman of Food Bank West Friesland at NH News. A specialized pest control company was also unable to get the pest under control. The building is cleared and cleaned. \\\"It's just a lot of work. Everything has to be emptied and checked. All holes we encounter have to be closed. Every product now goes through our hands,\\\" says Sipkes. The distribution points in Hoorn, Grootebroek, Opmeer and Medemblik closed on Tuesday and will be closed for at least two weeks. The approximately 150 families that depend on the food bank temporarily receive food vouchers. The extent of the damage is not yet known. Smaller charities have been hit hard by the corona crisis in the past year. They saw revenues decrease by an average of 13.4 percent compared to 2019. The major charities fared slightly less badly and lost only 0.3 percent of their income. This is evident from new research by Radboud University and the supervisor of charities, the CBF. The researchers talk about major differences between the various organizations. \\\"The number of one-off donations from private individuals has decreased, but events and fundraising actions such as schools organizing a run could also not take place,\\\" says Harmienke Kloeze, director at the CBF. \\\"Many charities have noticed this enormously.\\\" Another financial setback was that many companies withdrew as sponsors. 317 recognized charities participated in the study. Half, 159 organizations, reported a loss due to Covid-19. More than a quarter reported growth in income. Organizations active in developing countries noticed fewer negative consequences of corona. This also applies to nature organizations. Charities within education and science were having a hard time, as was the welfare category. Regular donors remain loyal to their organizations even in these corona times. Private donations play a positive role in the increases. This is mainly due to an increase in regular donors (34 percent) and inheritances (33 percent). \\\"It is great that this research shows that in these difficult times, Dutch people remain generous and that they show themselves to be loyal to various charities that prove to be so valuable especially in these times,\\\" the CBF said. Many large organizations converted their activities to online and alternative activities, such as the Corona Square of the Lung Fund, the food for poverty project of the Red Cross and the Ommetje of the Brain Foundation. Small charities were also open to innovation, such as social initiatives for vulnerable elderly people in the neighborhood. Kloeze: \\\"But it requires flexibility and a good infrastructure to make that change. This is usually easier for large organizations.\\\" It is striking that large nature organizations benefited enormously from the corona crisis. This applies, for example, to Natuurmonumenten. \\\"We added 39,000 members last year. That is a record number of new nature lovers,\\\" said a spokesperson. \\\"Many Dutch people work at home, often behind a screen. People then feel extra excited to go to heaths, dunes and forests during the corona crisis. We do that en masse. We are rediscovering nature.\\\" According to Natuurmonumenten, the number of visitors to nature reserves and the number of downloads of walking routes showed historically high growth last year. At the Plons Foundation in Rotterdam they can only dream of such great figures. The foundation, which organizes sailing activities for people with disabilities and seriously ill children, saw its income drop by two-thirds last year. \\\"Normally you are talking about 30,000 euros in donations per year, but now we did not get further than 10,000 euros. Fortunately, we have some fat on our bones, but this cannot continue for another year,\\\" says Mark van der Heijden of Plons. \\\"It is of course the worst for the participants. They miss sailing enormously. It is often an important outing for them, with which we also get them out of their isolation.\\\" According to Kloeze of the CBF, 15 percent of small organizations are concerned about the future. \\\"Many fundraising activities have to be prepared in advance. That takes time. If we are allowed to do everything again after corona, you will not have organized a new event in 1-2-3. It will take some time to renew those contacts with schools, for example. to build.\\\" A new law means that many people who have to deal with the bailiff have too little left to live on. Debt counselors have been raising the alarm about this for weeks. This concerns the Seizure-Free Fee Simplification Act, which came into effect at the beginning of this year. The seizure-free amount is the part of the income that the bailiff cannot seize. The law includes a calculation model that determines how high the seizure-free amount is. Housing costs are important in this regard. The model works with fictitious housing costs that match the level of income. But according to debt counselors and administrators, this does not take sufficient account of the fact that many people with a low income live expensively. Previously, there were problems with how the Tax Authorities applied the law and mistakes had been made with the settlement of the holiday allowance. If a bailiff seizes someone's income, the person must have enough money left over to pay the costs of basic necessities such as housing, food, clothing, energy and care. The amount required for these basic costs is called the seizure-free amount. Everyone is entitled to that. The seizure-free amount varies per family. The minimum is 95 percent of the social assistance standard (1,075.44 euros per month for a single-person household). But for families with higher housing costs, for example, the attachment-free threshold is higher, because otherwise they would not be able to make ends meet. The calculation module is intended for bailiffs who seize someone's income. But the attachment-free threshold also applies to people in a statutory debt process (Wsnp) and people for whom debt counselors make agreements about how much money goes to creditors. \\\"Many of the lower outcomes are unfair and practically unfeasible in terms of budget to make ends meet,\\\" states a joint message from Bureau Wsnp, which supports statutory debt restructuring, and the association of debt counselors NVVK. \\\"The reported problems are major and the signals come from all corners of the field: courts, administrators, debt counselors and debtors.\\\" The new law represents a simplification because the calculation uses generally applicable fictitious housing costs, instead of individual costs per file. \\\"In practice, it appears that in 25 to 40 percent of the files this leads to an often significant decrease in the amount to be released, as a result of which a debtor is regularly unable to make ends meet,\\\" say Bureau Wsnp and the NVVK. In the first six weeks, 1,000 signals were received that something was going wrong. In many cases this involved people who lived more expensively than the law assumed based on their income. \\\"The assumption that everyone can move to a home with housing costs appropriate to their income may have been somewhat realistic years ago when the new attachment law was developed. But that no longer appears to be the case.\\\" Debt counselors and administrators have started to improvise to ensure that there is enough left to live on. They have this option because, on top of the attachment-free threshold, they are allowed to keep a portion of the income that does not go to creditors. Initially, the consequences of the new law would be evaluated after six months. But in February, six weeks after it came into effect, NVVK and Bureau Wsnp already raised the alarm with the judges who decide on statutory debt restructuring, due to \\\"enormous unrest in the field\\\". Work is now underway to adapt the calculation method. This modified method is expected to be introduced at the beginning of May. Lawyer Andr\\u00e9 Moerman of Schuldinfo.nl says that the problem of a too low seizure-free amount due to high housing costs will continue after May for people whose income has been seized by the bailiff. This concerns people who are not in a debt process. \\\"The same rules then apply, while there is no administrator or debt counselor who checks whether there is enough left and can ensure a correction,\\\" says Moerman. Moerman believes that the formulas in the law should be quickly adjusted so that they better reflect the reality that many people with a low income have high housing costs. Participation in the National Vaccination Program in the four major cities is lowest among children and young people with a migration background. Figures from those cities show that migrant children mainly stay away from vaccinations for 14-year-olds against cervical cancer and meningococcus. Young people with a Turkish and Moroccan background appear to be the least vaccinated against these two diseases. This is followed by young people with a Surinamese or Caribbean-Dutch background. With MMR (mumps, measles, rubella) the differences are quite small. Organizations in youth health care are concerned about the lack of vaccination rates among children and young people with a migration background. Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht have therefore had an analysis carried out. In collaboration with the RIVM and the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport, the four cities now want to investigate what explanations there are for the differences. They also want to develop policy to ensure that more people participate in the National Vaccination Program. The four largest cities also want to exchange ideas and existing policies on this subject. Amsterdam will soon present a plan to increase the vaccination rate. This includes, among other things, that the GGD will investigate why people do not have their children vaccinated. Rotterdam wants to deploy so-called key figures to tailor information about vaccinations for migrants. For example, information meetings are organized with an imam. The Hague already works with key figures in neighborhoods with a relatively low vaccination rate. The municipality is also training health ambassadors to provide information in community centers. Utrecht also has a district-oriented approach. Youth health care takes extra time to talk to parents and answer questions about vaccination. Since the outbreak of the corona crisis, a lot has been saved in the Netherlands, almost 46 billion euros. That is more than 2.5 times as much as the year before. But a Rabobank survey shows that this money is unevenly distributed: most of the saved money ended up with 'only' 35 percent of the population. For others, the savings balance remained the same or decreased. How can these differences be so great? Whether someone saves a lot or a little usually depends mainly on income, says Rabobank economist Carlijn Prins. \\\"That was the case before corona, but also now. It is not absolute, but traditionally people with a higher income have more savings. And that trend has continued during corona.\\\" During corona times, those incomes and expenses have sometimes changed. For example, entrepreneurs have sometimes had to use their savings to keep their business afloat. The other way around also applies: if you had an above-average income pre-corona and spent less money on things such as holidays or the catering industry due to the lockdowns, the result may be that your savings have grown in the meantime. That makes sense, although the way in which the tens of billions in savings are now distributed is also a surprise to economists. Prins: \\\"We already thought that the money would end up more with people with a higher income. But we were surprised that it only reached 35 percent of the population. Because 46 billion euros is a very large amount, more than two times as much as the year before.\\\" Financial inequality did not appear out of the blue, but it was previously visible in expenditure, the economist thinks. \\\"People with an average or above-average income then spent more money than people with a low income,\\\" says Prins. \\\"Now that this was less possible due to corona, money that would otherwise be spent shifted to the savings account. The inequality in money has therefore shifted.\\\" \\\"This does not surprise us,\\\" responds spokesperson Gabriella Bettonville of Nibud, the foundation that informs and advises on household finances. According to her, the lockdowns were especially beneficial for people with high incomes: they are the ones who usually go out and book holidays. \\\"People with a low income have little or no budget for this, which is really a matter of collecting money.\\\" People with higher incomes were therefore also able to save more. \\\"That is also understandable: the more money you have, the more you can spend. But also the more you can put aside. There is a division in society and, in my opinion, this survey shows that once again.\\\" According to Nibud, having a lot or little savings is not even the most important issue. \\\"It is important that you have something in reserve. Because costs, for example in your house, will inevitably occur. You just don't know when. Don't be discouraged by these types of studies about the distribution of money. A little bit of savings also helps al. Look especially at your own wallet and what you need to have on hand.\\\" Rabo economist Prins agrees. \\\"Both from a personal and an economic point of view, it is nice if people have a reserve fund. At the moment there is a large group, 25 percent of the people, with little to no reserves. If things go wrong financially, they may have to rely on cutting back on their daily expenses, which is also not a boost for the economy.\\\" According to the economist, whether savings inequality will persist has to do with what people do with the extra savings and how it is spent. \\\"If you spend the money in the pub or shopping street, the money will run out at some point. If you put it in a mortgage or investment, you turn it into capital in a different way, which means, for example, that you have lower housing costs and structurally more Then the wealth inequality will remain the same.\\\" Demonstrators have gathered in Amsterdam and The Hague to protest against the situation in Colombia. The police have been cracking down on protesters there for days, protesting against the government. In Amsterdam people gathered on Dam Square. From the square they walk to the Colombian consulate on the Herengracht. According to AT5, several hundred people are on the move; ANP news agency speaks of several dozen demonstrators. The demonstrators marched in a colorful procession through the center of Amsterdam: In The Hague, demonstrations are taking place on Groot Hertoginnenlaan, the street where the Colombian embassy is located. Protesters carry protest signs with texts such as 'protect our people'. Mass protests against the government of President Iv\\u00e1n Duque are underway in the South American country for the tenth day in a row. At least 24 people have been killed so far. The dissatisfaction in Colombia was initially directed against a tax reform. Duque has since scrapped that reform, but demonstrators are now demanding that he also tackle problems such as inequality, poverty and police brutality. They also want Duque to resign. The president in turn accuses the activists of vandalism. The European Union previously called on security forces not to use force against demonstrators. The Collaborating Aid Organizations have opened Giro555 for corona aid to poor and vulnerable countries. The organizations are particularly concerned about the situation in India and Nepal and have therefore started a national campaign. The money raised will be used to help corona victims and purchase vaccines. \\\"We want to support healthcare in these countries by providing emergency medical care, but also by providing protective clothing, refrigerated distribution and information about the importance of vaccination,\\\" says Suzanne Laszlo, director of Unicef \\u200b\\u200bNetherlands and action chair of Giro555. The aid programs are therefore a supplement to the Covax program, through which the World Health Organizations, among others, distribute corona vaccines to poorer countries. Laszlo calls the situation in India, which is struggling with the second wave of the corona crisis, a disaster of unprecedented proportions. \\\"If you look at the images that are now coming out of India, they are staggering. The entire medical system is at a standstill, the number of deaths is increasing enormously.\\\" But the Unicef \\u200b\\u200bdirector is also concerned about the situation in Africa and other parts of the world. \\\"The disaster is also great there. Children do not go to school, malnutrition is becoming increasingly serious. There is poverty, economic systems have been disrupted. We must take action to eradicate that virus from the world.\\\" Laszlo hopes that now that more and more Dutch people have been vaccinated themselves, they will realize how important it is that the rest of the world also has access to vaccines. \\\"While people in the Netherlands are receiving protection, we would like to ask them to show solidarity with people in vulnerable countries where it is not yet self-evident that you will receive a vaccination. We are all only safe when everyone has been vaccinated.\\\" This is also emphasized by virologist Marion Koopmans, who was at the kick-off of the action this morning. \\\"Because the virus can spread so widely, as is now the case in India, new variants continue to emerge. The virus seizes its opportunity and with that we continue to have problems. So we must suppress it worldwide.\\\" This morning the starting signal for the relief campaign was given at the Jaarbeurs in Utrecht. It is not yet clear whether there will be a national day of action, but Giro555 will continue to campaign for at least a number of weeks. A structural approach must be taken quickly to offer people in vulnerable urban neighborhoods equal opportunities. Fifteen mayors and a number of organizations in the field of housing, work and education are calling for this today in an appeal to the negotiators for a new cabinet. Poverty, debt and unemployment are widening the gap with the rest of society. This is at the expense of social cohesion and safety in our country, they write. The approach will cost at least 500 million euros. According to Tilburg mayor Theo Weterings, this concerns at least a million people who live in sixteen vulnerable neighborhoods in large cities. \\\"We see, for example, that children come to school with a learning disability, in a place where development opportunities are limited from a young age,\\\" Weterings says in the NOS Radio 1 Journaal. According to Weterings, these children find it difficult to find work later or they do not have the right start to find \\\"that beautiful, future-oriented job\\\". People in the neighborhoods regularly struggle with persistent problems such as poverty, debt, unemployment and crime. There are also educational disadvantages and many residents suffer from poor health. The problems are a breeding ground for organized crime. Mayor of Amsterdam Femke Halsema cites her Southeast district as an example. \\\"Almost 100,000 people live there and some of them are really not doing well. That has little to do with them, but with the place where they were born and raised.\\\" The average level of education in the district is about the lowest in the country. \\\"And that has nothing to do with the talent or intelligence of those young people. It simply has to do with the opportunities they get,\\\" Halsema emphasizes. The cancellation of school during the corona crisis has only increased the problems, she says. Similar difficulties exist in the Nieuw-West district. Halsema: \\\"Low literacy there is almost 25 percent compared to 14 percent in other parts of the city and 21 percent of people feel unsafe.\\\" To solve the problems, Mayor Weterings of Tilburg advocates further expanding the so-called Rotterdam Act. In other words, the Special Measures for Metropolitan Problems Act, which was first used in Rotterdam, which gives municipalities more opportunities to improve the quality of life in vulnerable neighborhoods. As an example, he cites the National Program Rotterdam South (NPRZ) from 2012. It contains agreements such as additional primary education, a job guarantee for young people who obtain their MBO diploma, intensive guidance for job seekers and the construction of affordable housing for the middle class. The program has a duration of twenty years. \\\"That is a long process, which we will have to do together,\\\" says Weterings. \\\"But tackling the disadvantages in those neighborhoods is really necessary. In this way we give opportunities to people who have a lot of potential. And young people must have the right to grow up with equal opportunities.\\\" Halsema also emphasizes the importance of patience. According to her, project-based work has been done in poorer neighborhoods for too long. \\\"So then something is started for four years, there is an evaluation during that period and then it disappears again. But you have to commit to this for a much longer period. Because the problems are very persistent and very tough.\\\" She does not fear that the mayors' call will be overlooked by the many other calls currently being made to the future cabinet. \\u201cThe need in the country is very high, but this is also crucial for the recovery of our economy,\\u201d says Halsema. \\\"The young people who live there are our employees of the future. And the companies that establish themselves there are extremely important for the urban economies.\\\" Like many events, NLdoet was canceled last year due to the corona outbreak. This year, the largest volunteer campaign in the Netherlands was supposed to take place in March, but that was also canceled. But NLdoet is on the program today and tomorrow. Although with a more limited program than in other years, that does not matter to director Sandra Jetten of the organizing Oranje Fonds, she said in the NOS Radio 1 Journaal: \\\"Volunteers can go in 99 percent of the municipalities.\\\" In Deventer, for example, to renovate the garden of a healthcare institution. In Maastricht a water scouting ship is being painted and in Bergen they are taking the opportunity to clean the area around the library during a 'trash walk'. Cycling tours, walks and puzzle tours are also organized in the country for vulnerable people. The king and queen also rolled up their sleeves: Martina Priekaar is present in Utrecht. There, volunteers help sort baby items, from which packages are put together for parents who have little money. Priekaar: \\\"It's great to see how much is being donated. We also have regular volunteers who help us during the week, but NLdoet offers an extra option to come and sort.\\\" Once the items have been sorted, they are taken to the foundation's headquarters in Heerhugowaard. \\\"We provide approximately 5,000 baby starter packs per year, but unfortunately we cannot meet the demand. One in nine children in the Netherlands is born into poverty.\\\" In total, NLdoet organized around 5,500 actions this year. This is less than in previous years, when around 8,000 actions were organised. This has to do with corona, says Sandra Jetten: \\\"Additional measures have been taken. All jobs are arranged in such a way that they can be carried out at a distance of 1.5 meters. And many jobs that were supposed to take place indoors are canceled.\\\" It is impossible to say exactly how many volunteers will show up. About 10,000 people have registered via the NLdoet website, says Jetten. But many volunteers report directly to the individual organizers of the actions and not via the website. As usual, members of the royal family also participate. Two years ago, Prince Constantijn and Princess Beatrix helped refurbish musical instruments. Jetten does not want to reveal where King Willem-Alexander and Queen M\\u00e1xima will be found this year: \\\"But I believe a high-pressure cleaner will have to be used.\\\" In 2018, a generous amount of pancakes were baked by the royal couple: The Netherlands sets a \\\"unique negative example\\\" when it comes to children's education during the corona pandemic. When schools closed, children were used as a means to keep parents at home. Youth does not have any priority in Dutch corona policy, concludes children's rights organization KidsRights. Initiator and chairman of the board Marc Dullaert of KidsRights believes that the rights of children have been ignored. \\\"It has been announced on behalf of the cabinet that schools will be closed, because if children stay at home, it encourages parents to work from home.\\\" The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child monitors compliance with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. \\\"The Committee has determined that the interests and rights of children must be taken into account in corona measures and that did not happen here.\\\" Another example of what goes wrong, according to former Children's Ombudsman Dullaert, is the lack of clarity in secondary education. \\\"There is little direction. For example, we do not know how many schools have now opened. It is also not clear whether sufficient work has been done on ventilation.\\\" Dullaert's organization publishes an annual report on compliance with children's rights worldwide. In general, the Netherlands is doing well. It ranks fifth in a ranking of 182 countries. But a special report for this year's edition on the impact of the corona pandemic gives a different picture. KidsRights expects that the Netherlands will drop \\\"significantly\\\" in future rankings due to the consequences of the \\\"negligent\\\" corona policy for children. Closing schools in the Netherlands not only led to a learning deficit, it also had a negative impact on the mental health of children. The Kindertelefoon recently counted an average of 1,500 calls per day about domestic violence, depression, self-harm and suicidal thoughts. That number has doubled compared to last year. The Amsterdam UMC received 50 percent more children and young people with serious psychological problems. According to KidsRights, the situation in Belgium shows that things can be done differently. This has done everything it can to keep the schools open during the second lockdown. The corona-related problems have therefore remained lower among Belgian youth, according to Kidsrights. Worldwide, 1.5 billion children and young people no longer received education during the pandemic. 168 million children received no education for almost an entire year. 370 million children no longer received school meals, which can have serious consequences for their physical and mental health. 80 million infants did not receive vaccination against diseases such as malaria, polio or measles. Parents of 142 million children fell into poverty due to loss of income. There are also positive examples. In Bangladesh, many families do not have a computer or internet. The country has therefore been broadcasting homeschooling on national television since the beginning of the pandemic. The continent of Africa as a whole receives a compliment, because the interests of the child are paramount in all decisions. More than a third of households entitled to social assistance benefits do not use them. This concerns 170,000 households, reports the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment. Municipalities have little insight into it and do not pay enough attention to it. \\u201cThese are really shocking figures,\\u201d said Amma Asante, chair of the National Client Council (LC), which represents people on benefits. \\\"The signals have been known for some time, but I was shocked by the enormous size.\\\" The chance of non-use increases if people do have an income, but it is not enough to exceed the social assistance level. The more someone earns, the greater the chance of not using social assistance. According to the inspectorate, this mainly concerns self-employed people, young people up to the age of 27, and European migrants. Municipalities indicate during the inspection that they have little insight into non-users. Most municipalities have information about applying for assistance on the website, but do not make any effort to reach people themselves. The inspectorate calls it worrying that many households fall below the social minimum and calls on municipalities to take a more proactive approach. \\\"The current corona crisis requires extra attention to reaching rights holders. More people are currently at risk of falling into poverty due to a deteriorated labor market position.\\\" According to the Inspectorate, this research raises the question of how these households can still make ends meet without benefits. \\\"A quarter of non-user households with little or no income consist of children living at home,\\\" the Inspectorate writes in the report. According to the Inspectorate, it is likely that at least part of this group is supported by their parents. It is impossible to say on the basis of this research how many non-users actually live in poverty. According to the Association of Dutch Municipalities, this research raises a political question. \\\"Should the government encourage all people who are below the minimum to apply for benefits? For example, do we want young people who live at home and temporarily have no income and are supported by their parents to be encouraged to always turn to the municipality for income support? Or are these types of forms of co-reliance/self-reliance actually commendable?\\\", writes the association in a response to the research. Although municipalities have poor insight into non-users, most policy staff have the same view of the problems affecting the groups in question, the inspectorate writes. For example, young people often do not know that they are entitled to social assistance. According to the municipalities, people with a Western migration background have difficulty due to their poor command of the Dutch language. Unlike people with a non-Western migration background, they receive little guidance when they are new to the Netherlands. According to the municipalities, self-employed people are also difficult to reach. They often do not know that they are entitled to assistance or are too proud to apply for it. Another factor that plays a role is that people are reluctant to apply because of the complexity of the rules and because they are afraid that they will have to pay back if their income fluctuates. Municipalities' focus on fraud can also be a deterrent. People who are entitled to a small additional amount sometimes find it not worth it. For example, because they have varying incomes, which makes the application complicated, or because the legal tone of the municipality's communication is a deterrent. \\\"What we often hear at the National Client Council is that people say: wait a minute, I don't feel like receiving social assistance benefits at all. Because if I end up in it, I will be stripped completely naked and stripped of my humanity,\\\" says Asante . Anyone who receives benefits may be asked to show everything, she explains. \\\"You may have to show your bank statements. You may then be asked why you bought a meal from Thuisbezorgd.\\\" Not long ago, the LC commissioned a study into how attractive it is to look for work while receiving benefits, she says. \\\"A lot of people who are on benefits really want to work.\\\" The conclusion: \\\"That is not encouraged at all. Worse still, it is even punished. Because if you start working on benefits, there is a good chance that you will earn less. Much more attention is paid to: does someone not earn too much? , then: how can we ensure that work actually pays off.\\\" \\\"Using analysis of CBS micro data, the Inspectorate has investigated the extent of non-use of general assistance as of January 1, 2018 and the background characteristics of these non-using households. The Inspectorate chose this reference date because of the availability and completeness of the databases required for the analysis. The Inspectorate assumes that as of 2021 (at the time of publication of this report) these figures are still representative because non-use is a structural problem. The current corona crisis requires additional attention to non-use given the greater need for income support. Given this greater need, it is likely that the absolute extent of non-use in 2021 will in any case be greater than in 2018.\\\" Five United Nations special rapporteurs have expressed serious concerns about the housing policy of the municipality of Rotterdam in the south of the city. In a letter to the cabinet, they point out that the plans to reduce the number of affordable homes go against the right to decent housing. The Rotterdam residents who are affected by this policy are also not or hardly involved. \\\"We are very concerned that reducing the number of affordable homes will put more vulnerable people in a difficult position, with a risk of poverty and homelessness,\\\" the five wrote. The policy may also have a discriminatory effect, because many migrants and minorities live in South Rotterdam. A UN spokesperson says the letter is mainly intended to alert authorities to possible violations of rights and to obtain clarification about those suspected violations. The rapporteurs wrote the letter after a complaint was received about Rotterdam. The letter to the cabinet was signed by the UN rapporteurs on housing, right to development, human rights of migrants, minority policy, and extreme poverty and human rights. The UN rapporteurs are particularly unhappy about the controversial demolition and renovation of hundreds of houses in the Tweebosbuurt. Residents have been anticipating this for years, but housing association Vestia and the municipality are pushing ahead with the new construction plans. According to the rapporteurs, the procedure did not follow the rules. \\\"Tenants were unmistakably informed that their house would be demolished, while the city council had not yet made an official decision about this.\\\" As a result, the rights of the tenants have been violated, they argue. The residents got the impression that the demolition of their house was a fait accompli, against which there was no objection. They would also not have been offered an affordable alternative home in the area. Although residents had priority in looking for a new rental home, the rapporteurs felt that this measure fell short because there is such a serious shortage of houses. They are also concerned that Vestia may demolish the homes to make up for past financial losses instead of fulfilling its public duty by offering affordable housing. The residents of the Tweebosbuurt say that a heavy blow has been dealt to the municipality of Rotterdam. \\\"Justice at last. We have stated since the beginning that we are discriminated against on the basis of our socio-economic position.\\\" They want the demolition to be stopped immediately and ask the city council to conduct an in-depth investigation. In a response, the municipality and Vestia do not substantively respond to the criticism of the UN rapporteurs. They do say that they do not agree with the analysis, \\\"because it is largely based on factual inaccuracies and incomplete information\\\". They have invited the Dutch human rights ambassador Bahia Tahzib-Lie for a working visit so that they can explain their policy to her. There has not yet been a solution to the impasse in the cabinet formation. This is evident from the words of the party leaders who met with informant Hamer today. After his meeting, VVD leader Rutte said that the VVD's position had not changed last weekend. The VVD leader did \\\"call, think and do all weekend,\\\" he said. That was also Hamer's assignment, who wanted the leaders of VVD, D66, CDA, Christian Union, PvdA and GroenLinks to think about a solution to the impasse in which the formation finds itself. The VVD leader still wants to \\\"achieve a coalition with four parties as quickly as possible\\\". He did not want to say more about the process, because he believes it is precarious. \\\"And everything I say about it doesn't help.\\\" Rutte previously expressed his preference for continuing the current coalition with CDA, D66 and ChristenUnie. Rutte, like CDA leader Hoekstra, emphatically does not want to be in a coalition with GroenLinks and the PvdA together. The leader of the latter party, Lilianne Ploumen, criticized that attitude after her conversation. \\\"I am prepared to talk together with GroenLinks,\\\" said Ploumen, \\\"but two right-wing parties are blocking that, without giving reasons.\\\" According to her, VVD and CDA should reflect and not hope that they can loosen the PvdA and GroenLinks. \\\"They should stop trying and attempting to do so.\\\" Not surprisingly, GroenLinks leader Klaver has the same message. He thinks it is time for parties that can form a majority to talk. \\u201cWe show our responsibility,\\u201d he said. \\\"And for them to say: we don't even want to talk. That is political poverty.\\\" The stalemate that the parties have been in for months looks as follows: VVD and CDA do not want to work with both PvdA and GroenLinks, those two left-wing parties in turn do not want to do without each other, D66 wants \\\"as progressive as possible\\\" and not with the ChristenUnie and that party only wants to join if there is really no other option. Blockages, what are the parties afraid of? VVD and CDA have no interest in a coalition with PvdA and GroenLinks, because the left-wing bloc in the cabinet would then become very large. PvdA and GroenLinks have two more seats than the CDA. Moreover, only one party is needed for a majority. This could mean that the other party could claim a very free role and function as a left-wing 'outboard engine' of the coalition. Conversely, PvdA and GroenLinks are afraid that they will be snowed under if they enter the cabinet without the other. VVD, CDA and D66 are mainly to the right of the center in economic and social areas. As the smallest partner, they have little say in the matter, with the risk that the voter will punish them even further than is already the case. D66 is currently blocking a coalition with the Christian Union, due to the bad experiences in the current cabinet on medical-ethical issues. The Christian Union successfully prevented further expansions of euthanasia and abortion legislation, while D66 wants to make progress in that area. The Christian Union also points to the other parties. After his conversation with Hamer, party leader Segers said that he thinks it is time for the formation to be loosened, but that it is not his party's turn. \\\"It is clear in everything that we do not need to govern. We are taking a constructive position, but in the right order. We are at the back.\\\" Segers wants a coalition with PvdA and GroenLinks to be explored first. If that fails, then the Christian Union only comes into the picture. He is reluctant to negotiate with all six parties. \\\"Then you start mixing the content with the question of who with whom. I don't see how that can take us any further.\\\" If it is not possible to answer the question of who wants to be with whom, Hamer has other options. For example, the informant can ask Rutte and Kaag, the two winners of the elections, to write a coalition agreement together. Or she just asks the current outgoing Prime Minister. Other parties can then join based on the plans. Christian Union Segers did not comment on that option. \\\"You can read what I think about that in the informant's report. But I block almost nothing.\\\" All children who grew up in poverty and had to deal with family problems due to the benefits affair will receive financial compensation. This amounts to 1,500 to 7,500 euros, depending on their age. State Secretary Van Huffelen wrote this to the House of Representatives. This concerns approximately 70,000 children and young people. In addition to financial compensation, they receive long-term support in dealing with trauma and finding their way in society. Groups of children of 'benefit parents' have themselves advised the cabinet on this through discussions and panels. Van Huffelen thanks the children for their input and will continue to ask for their advice in the coming years. \\u201cThe loss of youth cannot be repaired retroactively in any way,\\u201d says Van Huffelen. \\\"The government can acknowledge their suffering and contribute to a better future.\\\" So far, more parents who have been affected by the childcare allowance affair have come forward than expected. The number of hours they need help in handling their case is also greater than expected: 35 hours instead of 20 hours on average. The organization set up for the settlement has therefore fallen behind. Van Huffelen has been trying for months to increase the number of employees, but it is not easy to find people with the right background. They also need to be trained and trained. Eight hundred people now work at the special organization. To date, 42,000 parents have registered for the Catshuis scheme. Of these, 19,000 parents have received the first compensation of 30,000 euros, after a 'light test' to determine whether they are eligible. Parents who are in serious financial difficulties and who cannot wait for the first compensation are helped more quickly. Their entire file has been assessed. So far this concerns a few thousand parents. Van Huffelen wants to use the summer to improve working methods to provide parents with more customized solutions. There are groups of parents who suffer less damage than the 30,000 euros they receive, but there are also parents who still need help in the coming years to get their situation back in order. The government is also working on arrangements and assistance for victims other than the parents, such as their ex-partners and victims of benefits other than the childcare allowance. The number of minors suspected of involvement in a stabbing incident did not increase further last year, according to a new inventory by the police. In 2020, this involved more than 400 boys and girls under the age of 18, almost the same as the year before, but twice as many as in 2018. The number of knives seized from young people continues to rise. In addition, the police note that youth crime is increasingly shifting to the cities. This is evident from an analysis published today in police trade magazine Blauw. The so-called hotspots in rural areas are disappearing. In urban areas, the police actually see an increase. \\\"You see this movement not only in the Randstad, but in cities throughout the Netherlands,\\\" says Pauline Klomp, head of Care and Safety at the National Police. The carrying and use of knives by young people is particularly worrying to the police. The knife problem among young people has been around for some time. In 2020, the NOS reported on the increasing number of stabbing incidents among minors, youth workers raised the alarm about the hardened street culture and gun ownership among young people and mayors asked for a knife ban. In November, the government announced that it was working on such a ban. The police have again mapped the number of stabbing incidents and knife possession among young people, up to and including 2020. The increase appears to be slightly stronger than previous police figures from the beginning of 2020 showed. The number of seized knives is increasing rapidly. \\\"But that may also have to do with the fact that we pay more attention and register it better,\\\" Klomp puts things into perspective. According to Klomp, local customization is particularly important in tackling these problems: \\\"Collaboration between all partners in the areas of care, safety and punishment is essential. Children often face problems in multiple areas, such as poverty, a difficult home situation or a older brother who has already come into contact with the law. You want to know those problem situations as early as possible and provide the right help or intervene.\\\" As an example, the police cite the arrest of 36 minors in September. The police received a tip about a fight between rival youth gangs in Zaandam. The youngest suspect was 13 years old. Several stabbing weapons were found when the young people were searched. All these young people were taken to a sports hall. \\\"Their parents had to pick them up there, but they were not allowed to go home immediately,\\\" says Klomp. The young people and their parents were led past a number of tables in the hall, with the police, youth work and the municipality behind them. They were told what the possible sanctions were and were then offered help for the family. \\\"That is effective, because it allows you to tackle the problems on the spot,\\\" says Klomp. \\\"You immediately make it concrete for the young people: this is the criminal law consequence and this is the possible help. With the entire community you can get the young people on the right path.\\\" Watch the video below that NOS Stories made last year about stabbing among minors: In Rotterdam, girls with parents on a low income can purchase sanitary towels and tampons from tomorrow with money from the municipality. Young people can purchase the products at Hema and pay with the youth credit on the Rotterdam Pass. The youth credit is an amount of money that has been released by the municipality for children from families with low incomes. With this, the municipality wants to ensure that these children can also participate at school and in their free time. With the youth credit they can buy sportswear and school supplies from affiliated stores and now also menstrual products. The reason for the measure is a motion by the PvdA in the Rotterdam city council on menstrual poverty, which means that girls or women have too little money to buy menstrual products. In Rotterdam, children aged 12 to 17 have a youth credit of 500 euros. So far, 17,000 children have received such a credit. Research shows that in the Netherlands, approximately one in ten girls and women between the ages of 12 and 25 have had difficulty obtaining menstrual products because there was no money for them. About two percent also said they had sometimes reused a tampon or sanitary towel because of the costs. The number of children growing up in poverty must be halved in the coming years and ultimately reduced to zero. This is stated in an initiative law that the PvdA and the Christian Union are presenting today. Currently, one in ten children grows up in a family with an income below the low-income limit used by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). That's about 250,000. The low-income limit is redetermined every year and adjusted to the price level. In 2019, this amounted to 1,660 euros net per month for a single-parent family with two minor children. For a couple with two children that was 2080 euros. PvdA and Christian Union want the law to state that child poverty must be halved by 2030. How that should be done is up to the cabinet. It must develop plans for this, release money and report annually on the status. In this way, the parties want more discussion about this \\\"silent disaster\\\". \\\"Everyone wants this,\\\" says Christian Union MP Don Ceder. \\\"We say: let's record it in a law. The government must report every year and we can make adjustments if necessary.\\\" If the target is stated in the law with a date, citizens could go to court if poverty among children has not been halved in nine years, admits PvdA member Gijs van Dijk. \\\"But it would be really bizarre if we were unable to achieve the target, and of course you want to avoid lawsuits as much as possible.\\\" The MPs are inspired by New Zealand, where a similar law has already been passed. Ceder: \\\"There are still children in our country who have to go to bed without dinner, do not have hot water at home or do not have good school supplies. Every child should be able to grow up without poverty.\\\" According to Van Dijk, the number of children in poverty has recently increased again, partly due to the corona crisis. \\\"That has to change.\\\" The House of Representatives wants higher compensation for children of parents who are victims of the benefits affair. State Secretary Van Huffelen planned to give this group an amount between 1,500 and 7,500 euros, depending on their age. Van Huffelen has had conversations about this with children themselves, but she deviated slightly from their advice. According to her, the children's proposal differed too much from other compensation schemes. But the House of Representatives believes that the outgoing State Secretary should adopt the advice in its entirety. A motion on this matter from D66, among others, was adopted unanimously. If Van Huffelen complies with the wishes of the House, this will mean that amounts ranging from 2,000 to 10,000 euros will be paid out. In a letter today, Van Huffelen writes that she will \\\"take the House's opinion into account in the further elaboration of the scheme\\\". The money is intended to provide support for children who have lived in uncertainty and poverty due to the allowance affair. Van Huffelen previously spoke about \\\"a starting amount to take control of their own lives\\\". In addition to financial compensation, the children also receive support to process traumas and develop further. About 70,000 children are eligible for the scheme. The pediatric intensive care units of Dutch hospitals are full of young children who have serious respiratory problems due to the RS virus. This year, children are less well protected against the virus due to the corona measures. But what about that? The RS virus, a respiratory infection, usually occurs in winter. \\\"Then everyone is exposed to the virus and we receive protection as a group,\\\" says Louis Bont, pediatrician and RS specialist at the Wilhelmina Children's Hospital in Nieuws en Co on Radio 1. Pregnant women are also exposed to it. They build up defenses against the virus and then pass on antibodies to their child in the womb. The children are then protected against the virus in the first months of life. Elise and Quint's baby also had to deal with the RS virus: 'Suddenly the whole roller coaster started running': Due to the lockdown and the one and a half meter rule, the RS virus has not been able to spread this winter and therefore no group protection has arisen. . And now that those rules have been loosened, the babies born from their mothers have not received any protection against the virus. \\\"That is why there are now many children who are at risk of a serious infection,\\\" says Bont. The pediatrician does not think this outbreak could have been prevented. \\\"No, that is really unthinkable for me. I have been researching this virus for 25 years and it is therefore something that I have really studied deeply. But until a few weeks ago I really would not have thought it possible that this would happen in the Netherlands.\\\" could happen. And besides, even if you know it, there's not much you can do about it.\\\" There is no vaccine against the virus yet, Bont expects that only in three to five years. In the meantime, parents of very young children can try to keep the virus at bay by washing their hands thoroughly before contact with their child, because the virus is transmitted directly through hand contact. \\\"So you can do something, but it only works to a very limited extent in practice,\\\" says Bont. It is very rare for children in the Netherlands to die from it. \\\"In the Netherlands, we are able to get the children through with the beautiful intensive care units that we have and that almost always works,\\\" says Bont. In the Netherlands, approximately 2,000 children end up in hospital every year due to infection with the RS virus. 150 to 200 of them have to go to intensive care to be put on a ventilator. \\\"In other parts of the world, where there are no intensive care units, and unfortunately that is the case in most places in the world, these children die from the RS virus. And it is therefore the second leading cause of death in the world among infants,\\\" says Bont. The pediatrician expects that the current epidemic will continue for a few weeks, but finds this difficult to estimate. \\\"Because we have never experienced a summer epidemic, it is difficult to say with certainty what we will see.\\\" He also expects another epidemic this winter. \\\"I just expect that we will have another strong RS epidemic around the Christmas period. It is not likely that summer epidemics will become normal,\\\" he says. The New Dutch Waterline is included on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The centuries-old complex of defense works is an extension of the Defense Line of Amsterdam, which has been on the list since 1996. The decision was somewhat unexpected, because an advisory body had recommended making some adjustments to the nomination in June. However, the original plan was approved at a conference in Funzhou, China. \\\"It also comes as a surprise to us,\\\" says spokesperson Kirke Mulders of the team that submitted the application. \\\"We happened to be meeting with a small part of our team and one colleague was prepared to bring a bottle of champagne. It has just been uncorked.\\\" North Holland deputy Zita Pels responded happily to the decision in a video connection with Funzhou. She called it an appropriate addition due to climate change and the recent floods in our region. \\\"The Dutch have learned to live with the danger of water and even use it to their advantage.\\\" The New Dutch Waterline is a complicated system of forts and locks, with which the surrounding landscape could be flooded: With the New Dutch Waterline, the west of the Netherlands could be protected against invading enemies by flooding large parts of land, inundations. For this purpose, a complex of 96 forts (including two castles and six fortresses), a hundred military locks, dikes and canals and more than a thousand concrete structures such as casemates were constructed. The line still runs like a green ribbon of 220 kilometers through four provinces, from Muiden to the Biesbosch. The position was used three times between 1815 and 1940: during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870/1871 and during the First and Second World Wars. In 1940 it turned out that the tactic was outdated: planes could pass the line effortlessly. Mulders says that the nomination could be cashed in because a lot of work has been done since the negative advice was drawn up. \\\"We submitted the application in 2019 and have not stood still in recent years. They were very strict, but more has been done than they indicated.\\\" She emphasizes that the work is not over yet. \\\"There were still some minor conditions, but even if they are met, we will always continue to protect and promote. We now have obligations.\\\" It is the first new piece of world heritage for the Netherlands since the Rotterdam Van Nelle Factory was included in 2014. Other Dutch mentions include the canal belt of Amsterdam, the historic city center of Cura\\u00e7ao and Schokland, which was the first to receive a mention in 1995. In addition, the Netherlands has a chance to win new entries twice this week: the application from the Colonies of Benevolence is expected to be discussed later this afternoon in Funzhou. That ambitious project from 1818 to combat poverty in the Netherlands was given homework two years ago, but now has a good chance of being included on the list. The former border of the Roman Empire in our country and Germany, the Limes, also has a chance of being officially declared a World Heritage Site later this week. Being included on the list is primarily a matter of honour, it does not mean, for example, that more money will be made available. However, the honorary title usually helps to attract more tourists. The Colonies of Benevolence have been added to the UNESCO World Heritage List. The two-century-old settlements in Frederiksoord, Wilhelminaoord and Veenhuizen are mentioned together with the colony in Wortel, Belgium. The Colonies of Benevolence are the eleventh Dutch entry on the World Heritage List. Earlier today, the Defense Line of Amsterdam was significantly expanded with the New Dutch Waterline. The ambitious project was set up in 1818 to combat poverty among the population. Paupers from the cities were given a piece of land and some cattle in the countryside to learn to support themselves. Their children were compulsorily sent to school. \\\"The colonies were a social experiment in combating poverty. They can be a sign of hope for humanity in how efforts are being made to improve the conditions of the poor and vulnerable,\\\" Drenthe deputy Cees Bijl responded via video link. He added that it also produced a beautiful landscape and invited everyone to come and take a look. This can be seen, among other things: The colonies were a unique initiative in Europe and are considered the beginning of the Dutch welfare state, because for the first time the government attempted to improve the lot of the poorest on a large scale. However, the colonies were not very successful: the intention was to make the project profitable, but money was always needed. In 2018, an attempt was also made to get the colonies on the World Heritage List, but that failed. UNESCO actually only wanted to include places like Frederiksoord, where the original village view had been preserved; Veenhuizen would have been too marred by the prison complexes that were built there later. In order to have a better chance this year, the initiators left the colonies of Willemsoord, Ommerschans and the Flemish Merksplas out of the nomination in the second chance. As a result, the organization was now able to convince a UNESCO conference in Funzhou, China, that it is precisely the cohesion of the remaining settlements that makes the project unique. The inclusion on the list is primarily a matter of honour; it does not mean, for example, that more money will be made available for the colonies. However, the honorary title usually helps to attract more tourists. In anticipation of this, museum texts in the colonies, for example, have already been translated into English. With the colonies and the Waterline, Dutch additions have been added to the list for the first time since 2014: in that year the impressive Van Nelle factory was included in Rotterdam. Other Dutch mentions include the canal belt of Amsterdam, the historic city center of Cura\\u00e7ao and Schokland, which was the first to receive a mention in 1995. The New Dutch Waterline is a complicated system of forts and locks: Because the Colonies of Benevolence were an initiative of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, when Belgium was still part of our country, they are the first multinational cultural heritage of the Netherlands. However, the Wadden Sea was previously declared a natural heritage of the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark. A second Dutch nomination may be awarded the day after tomorrow: the Dutch-German entry from the Limes will be assessed, the former northern border of the Roman Empire that ran through these countries. It is expected that that entry will also make it, although a decision on the southern part of it in Austria, Germany, Hungary and Slovenia was postponed for several days. Belgium achieved a second mention last weekend, with the joint recognition of the important European spa resorts such as Spa, Bath (UK), Vichy (France) and Baden-Baden (Germany). The request for the impressive French lighthouse of Cordouan was also honored, as was the request for the frescoes of Padua. Good morning! Today the RIVM will release the weekly corona figures. And the application round for the healthcare bonus closes for healthcare employees who have worked under exceptional circumstances in the fight against the coronavirus. Today starts off dry except for a few showers. Later, cumulus clouds will form and locally there will be heavy showers with a chance of thunder and lots of rain. With a moderate southwest wind it will be approximately 22 degrees. It will remain changeable in the coming days, the temperature will also take a step back. Are you going on the road? Here you will find an overview of the work. Check the railway timetable here. How did the Dutch Olympians perform last night? Read a brief overview here. And below you can see the program for today. As of today, stricter rules apply to Dutch people visiting Germany. Travelers from the Netherlands must be quarantined for five days after arriving in Germany, unless they have been fully vaccinated or have recovered from the coronavirus. The rules apply to all travelers aged 6 years and older. For many families this means an end to their holiday plans. Travelers must show proof of vaccination, test or recovery. They must also pass on this information to the German authorities via the internet. The Robert Koch Institute, the German counterpart of the RIVM, announced the tightened entry restrictions last week, after it became known that the new infections in the Netherlands per 100,000 inhabitants are almost thirty times lower than in Germany. Both the New Dutch Waterline and the Colonies of Benevolence in Drenthe have been added to the World Heritage List. This list from the UN organization UNESCO includes historic cities, buildings and national parks worldwide, such as the Great Wall of China, the Grand Canyon in America and the pyramids in Egypt. The project 'The Colonies of Benevolence' was set up in 1818 to combat poverty. Paupers from the city were given a piece of land and some cattle in the Drenthe countryside and their children were forced to go to school. According to Drenthe deputy Cees Bijl, this has \\\"resulted in a beautiful landscape\\\". Judge for yourself: Happy Tuesday! The global economy is becoming divided into two blocs as economic growth prospects for developed and less developed economies diverge following the pandemic. This is stated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the latest World Economic Outlook. The economic prospects for the less developed economies are much less favorable because they are struggling with flaring infections and a rising number of Covid deaths. For strong and developed countries, a strong recovery of the economy lies ahead through, among other things, broad vaccination and monetary and political support. The IMF expects the world economy to grow by 6 percent this year, the same amount as in the spring estimate. Growth has been adjusted upwards for the strong economies, while growth expectations have been lowered for the emerging economies, especially in Asia. Global economic growth in 2022 is estimated at 4.9 percent. In countries such as India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam, the new wave of infections is putting a heavy burden on economic recovery. The low and slow number of vaccinations is to blame for this, the IMF notes. An estimated 80 million more people will fall into extreme poverty, due to the loss of work and income due to the pandemic and lack of vaccinations and political support programs. In addition to the differences in vaccinations and political support, other factors also play a role in the economic recovery. New Covid variants, such as the delta variant, lead to many new infections and lockdowns here and there. In addition, there are all kinds of aftershocks and aftereffects in supply and demand, and production and transport, which hinder economic recovery. Container shipping is still in disarray. In smaller ports there are many empty shipping containers, while in important ports there is a dire shortage of containers, which drives up the price of container transport. As a result, the supply and production chains are experiencing significant delays. Rising inflation is also putting pressure on the recovery. Commodity prices, food prices and house prices have risen sharply due to rising demand now that the economy is open again, but supply and demand are often out of sync. Temporary shortages from chips to bicycle parts, and from homes to cars, drive up prices and slow the economy. According to the IMF, uncertainty about the economic recovery remains quite high. Regardless of how weak economies fare, social unrest, geopolitical tensions, cyber attacks on important infrastructure, and natural disasters such as fires and floods can have a major impact on economic recovery. It was hard fought for: the agreement in the pension agreement that people with a demanding profession can retire earlier. Initial figures indicate that it is not yet being used much. In a letter published by Trouw this morning, Minister Wouter Koolmees of Social Affairs and Employment answers questions from the House about the status of the scheme. In the first four months of this year, 1,447 people used it. It is not exactly clear how many people could make use of the Early Retirement Scheme (RVU) during this period. Anyone who cannot work until their state pension date because the work is too hard can stop three years earlier. In the last few years, the employer actually pays the AOW: more than 22,000 euros per year. Since January 1, it has also been legally regulated that 52 percent tax will not be deducted from this. Employees can use it if agreements have been made with the employer. At the end of March, 1.5 million Dutch people were covered by a collective labor agreement in which this was arranged. Nieuwsuur previously explained what this new system looks like: Not all of them have a physically demanding job, and not all of them are close to retirement age. According to Koolmees, it may also be that not everyone who retires early has already been registered. \\\"It is very early to take stock, but it is a first assessment,\\\" says FNV director Willem Noordman. \\\"What you see reflected in the figures is that low-paid people in particular have the greatest difficulty deciding whether to use the scheme.\\\" According to him, this is because people have to supplement the money they can receive, more than 22,000 euros, in some way to make ends meet. From retirement age onwards this often happens with the supplementary pension. But anyone who retires earlier must close that gap until retirement age. Early leavers can supplement that basic amount in various ways. For example, by withdrawing some money from the pension pot from which the supplementary pension will later be paid. The later benefit will then be less. This can be a difficult choice for people with a low income and a low supplementary pension. \\\"Everything they take out of their relatively small pension pot to supplement that benefit has consequences for the rest of their lives. For lower-paid people, every tenner is a substantial part of their income.\\\" According to the figures in the letter, relatively many employees in construction and the police have used the scheme so far. \\\"That is not unexpected because these sectors have had a collective labor agreement about the RVU since January 1 of this year.\\\" Noordman points out that these are sectors where people normally have a reasonable salary and pension. \\\"But if you talk about cleaning or the meat industry, wages are simply a lot lower and they have less pension accrual. That means that people really have to think three times before taking that step.\\\" However, the FNV member does not believe that his union should not have signed for the scheme. If this had not been there, there would have been no benefit in case of early retirement. \\\"Then you have to take a much bigger bite out of your pension to stop working earlier.\\\" The arrangement in its current form is temporary and applies until 2025. Discussions will take place in the near future about how to proceed. Noordman calls the initial findings \\\"learning fees for the consultation for the structural arrangement\\\". Employers' organization VNO-NCW, which has also endorsed the current scheme, was unable to respond at short notice. The municipality of Wijdemeren is allowed to reclaim part of the social assistance benefit from a woman because she received groceries from her mother. The judge ruled this today on appeal. What has the ruling made clear, and what questions remain unanswered? The assistance is intended as a safety net for those who cannot provide for themselves. According to Evert Verhulp, professor of employment law (UvA), it was a very conscious choice by the municipality to reclaim the amount from that woman. \\\"As a society, we only want to pay people if they cannot provide for their own livelihood. If someone else pays part of it, then society no longer has to do so. Legally, that is simple.\\\" The woman in Wijdemeren received groceries every week. Groceries are seen as a cost savings. But the social assistance benefit cannot be reduced immediately. There must be a 'special situation'. In this case that was the case, because the woman received the messages \\\"substantially and structurally\\\" according to the judge. She no longer had to buy these groceries with her benefits, which resulted in \\\"substantial savings\\\". According to Verhulp, the rules are partly like this because a lot of attention is paid to possible abuse of the scheme. \\\"If we want things to be different, we have to change the law. But don't complain if a municipality implements the laws.\\\" In today's ruling, the judge emphasizes that it is best for someone on social assistance to give up everything that is important for the amount of the benefit. Receiving a bag of groceries once is not \\\"substantial and structural\\\". But it is not always clear how many shopping bags there are. The municipality makes a decision about this, and in this case also the judge. The House of Representatives reacted indignantly to the sanction imposed by Wijdemeren. A proposal from various parties to allow people on social assistance to receive 1,200 euros in donations annually without being cut, received a majority. But it is up to municipalities themselves to determine what donations are allowed. As a result of this 'shopping affair', a number of municipalities have introduced the 1,200 euro exemption. But this expansion of the exemption does not help people who receive groceries, the judge explains in his ruling. Because groceries are not gifts, but a cost saving on living costs. If you receive a gift, for example a necklace, you still need the benefit to provide for your living expenses. If you get groceries, it reduces your need for benefits. \\\"A major benefit from the affair is that more people have come to realize that implementing the Participation Act can lead to undesirable outcomes,\\\" says lawyer Andr\\u00e9 Moerman of the website redactieinfo.nl, which first drew attention to the case. \\\"The Ministry of Social Affairs organized all kinds of meetings to discuss bottlenecks in the Participation Act. The case has reached the House of Representatives, and there is a draft bill to make reclaims not mandatory.\\\" The Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment will launch an investigation after the summer into \\\"harshness within social security legislation. The next cabinet can build on the results,\\\" says a spokesperson. The lawyer of the woman from Wijdemeren believes that her client should have been able to receive groceries with impunity, because they can be compared to help from the food bank. The judge disagreed. Because before the food bank starts providing food, an income test takes place. In addition, assistance from the food bank is in principle limited to a certain time. None of these rules applied to the messages the woman received, the judge ruled. An increasing number of people over 65 in the Netherlands still do paid work. The Central Bureau of Statistics reports this based on figures over the past 17 years. The increase is partly because there are more elderly people due to an aging population. But also within that group, the number of people in paid work has increased. This is mainly due to the increase in the state pension age, which determines until when people have to work before they receive a pension benefit from the government. That age was previously 65 years, but has now risen to 66 years and 4 months. In addition, a larger proportion of people over 67, for whom the state pension age no longer plays a role, have paid work. CBS has not investigated why this is the case. It may be that people live longer. That is also why the state pension age is increasing: it is linked to life expectancy. During the period over which Statistics Netherlands looked at the figures on working elderly people, the average life expectancy for people over 65 increased by approximately 2 years. On average, they are expected to live another 20 years after retirement. The number of households over 65 with debts has also increased relatively, which could be a reason for older people to continue working with pay. Of the more than 2 million households with elderly people, around 90,000 had a debt in 2019. At the same time, they represent only a small part of the number of senior households. There were approximately 1.2 million with a net worth of more than \\u20ac100,000, often due to the value of their own home. Internationally, the Netherlands is one of the countries with the lowest poverty among retirees, according to Statistics Netherlands. The elderly who currently continue to work for pay beyond their retirement age are relatively often men. And there are major differences between professional groups. For example, more than a quarter of all working visual artists are now over 65 years old. That is the highest percentage of all professional groups. Drivers, furniture makers, tailors and upholsterers are also relatively often still active as they get older. Rents increased by an average of 0.8 percent in July compared to a year earlier. That is the smallest rent increase since 1960, reports the Central Bureau of Statistics. The price increase of social rental housing was 0.3 percent and that of housing in the private sector 2.2 percent. The small rent increase is no coincidence. Due to legislation due to the corona crisis, the rents of regulated rental properties may not increase for a year as of July 1. Last year, the maximum permitted rent increase was 5.1 to 6.6 percent. Furthermore, a one-off rent reduction was introduced this year for tenants at housing associations if there is a high rent and a low income. A landlord does not have to adhere to the maximum rent increase when a new tenant moves into the home. In those cases, the average rent in July was 7.2 percent higher than a year earlier. That was still 9.5 percent in 2020. For a private sector home, the annual rent increase for the next three years is limited to 1 percentage point higher than inflation. This year that is a maximum of 2.4 percent. It was previously known that rents in the private sector continued to fall with new rental contracts. This was mainly because expats stayed away from the big cities due to the corona crisis. Rent increases in July are not the same everywhere in the country. Of the four major cities, rents in Utrecht rose the most, by 1.6 percent compared to a year earlier. The increase was the lowest in The Hague, namely 0.8 percent. In terms of provinces, Overijssel had the highest rent increase at 1.4 percent. Existing tenants in Groningen and Drenthe saw no difference in their rent compared to a year earlier. The VU Medical Center in Amsterdam has placed an embryo in sixteen women that may be infected with a bacterium that can cause meningitis. The infections happened last week in the laboratory of the IVF center in the hospital. A total of 31 women's embryos have come into contact with the bacterium Sphingomonas koreensis. The embryos that have not yet been transferred have been frozen, the hospital confirmed to NH Nieuws. The hospital has temporarily suspended all IVF-related treatments until it is clear where the infection comes from. The bacteria are not dangerous for healthy people, says a hospital spokesperson. \\\"The risk is not very great for the embryo. Nor for the patient. The report is therefore more out of due care than because you as a practitioner are afraid that something will go wrong,\\\" says clinical embryologist Sebastiaan Mastenbroek of the Amsterdam UMC, location AMC. With IVF (abbreviation for in vitro fertilization), fertilization takes place outside the woman's body. Sperm cells from the man and an egg cell from the woman are brought together in a laboratory under the right conditions, so that the egg cell is fertilized. The resulting embryo is then placed in the woman's uterus. Maria* is one of the women who had to deal with it. A few days after the transfer, she heard that something may have gone wrong and is very concerned about the development of her unborn child. \\\"I received a call from someone from the VUmc the day after the transfer,\\\" she told NH Nieuws. \\\"The anxious tone in the call immediately betrayed: something went wrong here. They don't know yet what the consequences could be for me or my child.\\\" She was advised to report to the emergency room if she experiences abdominal complaints or fever. The contamination came to light this weekend during the daily check of the culture dishes containing embryos. The bacterium was found there. All prospective parents involved have been called about the infection. A spokesperson for Freya, a national association for people with fertility problems, says the impact is significant. \\\"If you have a desire to have children and you want to fulfill it with the help of doctors, then that is very intimate. You are handing over your desire to have children. Then this is a message that hits you very hard.\\\" Those affected can turn for help. \\\"We cannot do anything medically. But we can provide a listening ear.\\\" The hospital is conducting research into the bacteria and the possible consequences for the embryos. It also maps out how the infections could have happened. * Maria is a fictitious name. The real name is known to the editors of NH Nieuws. Healthcare in the Netherlands is not ready for the future. There is a lack of sharp and clear choices from the government. If politicians continue to delay in making difficult decisions, healthcare as we know it will soon no longer be self-evident. That is the gist of the report 'Choosing sustainability. People, resources and social support' of the Scientific Council for Government Policy (WRR). In it, the WRR takes a closer look at current health policy and explains how it can be improved. Councilor Marianne de Visser is the first to admit that the facts collected are generally not new. It's about the urgency and the coherence between the numerous bottlenecks, she says. \\\"We are sounding the alarm.\\\" A major problem is the increasing healthcare expenditure, which now amounts to around one hundred billion euros per year. Due to, among other things, an aging population, an expected increase in the number of chronically ill people and a deteriorating lifestyle, expenditure will triple in forty years, the WRR warns. An increase that is greater than average economic growth. In other words: healthcare threatens to eat up our growth in prosperity, according to the report. Currently, approximately one in six or seven Dutch people work in healthcare, in twenty years that would be one in four, and in 2060 one in three. \\\"These are numbers that may not actually correspond with reality,\\\" says De Visser. \\\"Moreover, they mean that if you use all that money and all those people for healthcare, you cannot use them for other public purposes. For example, education. It will be a squeeze on all sides.\\\" The WRR adds a warning to this observation: cuts in other policy areas in order to continue to finance healthcare could further increase healthcare costs. \\\"Good education and poverty reduction are very important policy components to bring better health to broad sections of the population,\\\" says De Visser. \\\"You have to keep investing in that.\\\" To control healthcare costs, the main focus has been on working more efficiently. \\u201cWe must continue with that,\\u201d says De Visser. \\\"But it is not nearly enough to keep up with the rising demand for care.\\\" The WRR recommends better investigating the options for bringing healthcare workers from abroad. The report authors point out that the share of doctors trained abroad in the Netherlands is much lower than in Germany and Belgium. This also applies to nurses. Scarcity in healthcare is inevitable, says the WRR, and society should be well prepared for the fact that choices in healthcare are necessary. Making the choices themselves must also be better regulated, for example when it comes to what works well and what does not. This assessment currently only takes place for some of the medicines. The question should also be asked, and answered, in assistive devices and long-term care. The WRR also believes that determining what is reimbursed from the basic package needs improvement. The council points to situations in which experts determine that a medicine is too expensive, but the minister reverses that decision under social pressure. This division of roles and responsibilities must change, De Visser outlines. \\\"The government must establish general standards: that is actually the answer to the question of what a year in good health should cost.\\\" \\\"An independent supervisor must determine for individual treatments whether they meet the standard. And health care purchasers, such as health insurers, then try to ensure that care is provided as efficiently as possible,\\\" says De Visser. The WRR warns against 'pendulum policies', citing as an example cutbacks after the financial crisis, which caused healthcare workers to leave. The empty spaces had to be filled in again later. \\\"We advocate better, but also sharper, difficult choices,\\\" says De Visser. \\\"Priorities will have to be set. This means that you now have to pay a lot of attention to good personnel policy in the short term.\\\" The WRR research will be presented this afternoon to outgoing Minister Hugo de Jonge (CDA) of Health. Due to a unique combination of circumstances, prices for electricity and gas are rising at an unprecedented pace this year. If prices remain this high, millions of households with variable rates will face significantly higher energy bills after January 1. Anyone who currently signs a new contract will quickly pay tens of euros more per month. \\\"We are certainly concerned,\\\" says Elske Thomassen of the Energiebank Rotterdam, an organization that helps people save energy. \\\"It is already difficult for many people to pay their energy bills.\\\" Whether, how much and when someone will notice the sky-high prices depends mainly on the type of energy contract someone has and the insulation of the home. First of all, the term of the contract is important. Anyone who has fixed the prices for a longer period of time will not notice anything to begin with. This applies to four in ten households. But anyone who has an expiring annual contract and wants to enter into a new annual contract currently costs 500 euros more per year compared to 2020, reports price comparator Pricewise. Martien Visser, lecturer in energy transition at Hanze University of Applied Sciences Groningen, also expects a significant price increase in that case, namely around 400 euros. Both are based on what an average household consumes. This energy coach visits families and gives tips on saving energy: Anyone who does not renew an expiring contract and does not switch to another supplier will automatically end up in an indefinite contract with variable prices. Almost half (44 percent) have such a contract, according to the latest Energy Monitor from the supervisory authority for the Consumer and Markets Authority. In practice, these rates are adjusted twice a year. These variable rates already increased on July 1, although on average this was still manageable. Since then, the gas price, which also largely determines the price of electricity, has roughly doubled. If prices remain as high as they are now, there will be a new increase in January. \\\"That could be a big hit,\\\" says Tomas Bleker of Pricewise. \\\"Everyone is holding their breath.\\\" Insulation is also an important factor, especially for people with so-called energy poverty. This includes someone who spends at least 10 percent of their income on energy. That is approximately 650,000 households in the Netherlands. They currently do not have enough money for heating, lighting or cooking, according to research by TNO last year. \\\"A large proportion of people with energy poverty live in houses with less insulation,\\\" says Elske Thomassen of the Energy Bank. \\\"They are dependent on the housing association. They cannot make everything more sustainable at the same time.\\\" An important nuance is that the gas price can also drop again quickly. For example, if the winter is mild or if the new Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is put into use. What is sensible to do with an expiring or already variable energy contract? \\\"I honestly don't know,\\\" says lecturer Martien Visser. According to him, the market is currently assuming a mild winter and the opening of Nord Stream 2 in the longer term. \\\"If that is disappointing, the contracts will become even more expensive. If, on the other hand, things are not too bad and you have committed to a network for a longer period, you pay more than necessary for a longer period of time.\\\" High energy prices are certainly not exclusive to the Netherlands. In other European countries it has already led to protests and government intervention. Protests are also taking place in the Netherlands, but not on the streets. Major energy consumers wrote a letter to the Ministry of Economic Affairs this week. They demand that the government intervene. Aluminum factory Aldel confirms after reports from RTV Noord that it will be \\\"finished quickly\\\" at these prices. Fertilizer producer Yara will reduce ammonia production in Europe by 40 percent, because the high gas price is putting too much pressure on profits. The location in Sluiskil (Zeeland) will account for part of this production reduction. After the weekend, the company expects to have more clarity about the details and impact of the production reduction on the Netherlands. The near future looks remarkably good economically. This was said by outgoing Minister Hoekstra when presenting the Budget Memorandum for next year to the House of Representatives. According to estimates by the Central Planning Bureau, the economic recovery after the corona crisis will continue somewhat stronger than previously thought. The CPB assumes economic growth of 3.5 percent next year and 3.9 percent this year. According to Hoekstra, the relatively good figures can mainly be attributed \\\"to the adaptability of entrepreneurs and the entire society and to the support packages.\\\" In Parliament, he also pointed out that during the corona crisis, many people helped others, not out of self-interest, but because they wanted to be there for each other. Watch here how the Minister of Finance presented the budget to the House of Representatives: He acknowledged that the favorable figures do not say everything about the lives of individual people, who, for example, have lost someone due to corona or who have lost income. \\\"For them, the old normal has not yet returned,\\\" Hoekstra said. According to the government, the most drastic phase of the corona crisis is behind us, but risks remain. That is why 2 billion will be invested in the fight against corona for next year. Standards must be set for spending money, otherwise you will never be able to explain that the costs must also be increased, says the Council of State. Read the response from the government's main advisory body in this article. The government finds developments in the labor market more positive than expected. Nearly 70 percent of 15 to 74 year olds are working, a new record. Unemployment will rise slightly next year, and the national debt will fall. The budget deficit is estimated at 6 percent this year and is expected to drop to 2.4 percent next year. On average, the purchasing power of Dutch people remains the same or improves at least (0.1 percent). The government has not taken any major measures in this area, but it says it wants to show \\\"a balanced purchasing power picture\\\". The precise consequences per person depend on the individual situation. Hoekstra said in the House of Representatives that an outgoing cabinet normally adopts a reserved attitude, but that some problems cannot wait. For example, the government is allocating almost 7 billion euros extra for climate policy (partly intended to comply with the Urgenda ruling on the reduction of CO2 emissions). For example, significantly more is spent on a subsidy for sustainable energy. The government is also setting aside extra money for housing construction (to accelerate the construction of new homes), defense (including for extra ammunition), combating undermining crime and the security of people. The social legal profession will also receive more. Additional resources will also be allocated to tax relief, especially for people with a low income, single-income households and families. The government expects that the premium for basic insurance for healthcare costs will increase by approximately 2.75 euros per month next year. The insurers will determine the final premiums later this year. The premium increase is compensated for people with a lower income through the healthcare allowance. The deductible remains 385 euros. The additional investments in new measures are partly financed with the money that was actually intended to pay for the abolition of dividend tax. When that abolition did not happen, the idea was to reserve the money for the business community, but that has now also been scrapped. There is no new cabinet yet, but there must always be a budget for next year. The Budget Day pieces were drawn up by the current coalition of VVD, D66, CDA and ChristenUnie. These four parties broadly endorse the budget. It is customary for an outgoing cabinet to no longer make major decisions. So in principle the following applies: do not create new policy and only handle current matters. Last weekend it became clear that VVD, D66 and CDA (the negotiating parties in the formation) would like to sit down with other parties from the \\\"broad center\\\" to possibly adjust the budget, but so far nothing concrete has been achieved. led. The economy is making a strong recovery from the corona crisis and will grow by 3.5 percent next year, after growth of 3.9 percent this year. This is what the Central Planning Bureau expects in the so-called Budget Day Macro Economic Outlook. The Dutch economy will therefore get through the corona period relatively well, partly due to tens of billions in government support for companies and the innovative Dutch business community, as the king put it in the Speech from the Throne. By the end of this year, the economy will already be bigger than before corona, the CPB expects. If a new lockdown is necessary in the near future, the economy will continue to grow, but less: 3.3 percent this year and 2.2 percent next year. And the corona crisis has in any case caused the economy to lag behind for a long time. The economy will permanently remain about 1.5 percent smaller than it would have been without corona, the CPB thinks. There is such a shortage of workers on the labor market that unemployment will only rise slightly, even when the support measures for companies are over. In August unemployment was 3.2 percent, for 2022 the CPB expects an average of 3.5 percent. View the CPB's most important economic expectations here: The national debt will therefore fall relatively again next year, partly because the economy is growing rapidly. The debt therefore remains below the EU maximum of 60 percent compared to the size of the country's economy. There is discussion among economists about whether it is necessary for the national debt to remain so low. Due to the corona crisis, countries do not have to adhere to that maximum. We recently made this video about the Dutch national debt: Then the purchasing power. We have a caretaker cabinet and so this is a 'policy-poor' Budget Day, in other words, few major decisions have been made. We also see this in the area of \\u200b\\u200bpurchasing power. The CPB expects that little will change in terms of purchasing power for large groups. The CPB does not take changes in your life into account in its calculations of purchasing power. The CPB actually pretends that everyone's circumstances remain the same: everyone keeps the same job, no one is fired or works less or more. The only variables that the CPB does include in its purchasing power forecast are the expected development of wages, inflation and government policy. For example, are you a self-employed person in a sector that will still struggle next year due to corona and will you receive fewer assignments? Then your purchasing power can fall much faster than the CPB figure. Or will you work a few more hours per week? Then your purchasing power can increase much faster. The purchasing power of an average household will increase minimally next year, by 0.1 percent. This therefore applies to the average household and not to all households. For example, five percent of households will deteriorate by 0.7 percent or more and five percent of households will also improve by 0.8 percent or more. And as always, the economy could develop differently next year, with consequences for purchasing power. For example, if inflation rises faster than expected and wages and benefits do not rise, purchasing power will decrease for many people. See below what the average purchasing power development is for different groups: If a new cabinet is appointed soon, this purchasing power picture may still change before 2022. Perhaps they want to give working people more purchasing power, for example by lowering taxes for them or perhaps for people on benefits. The National Institute for Budget Information (Nibud) believes that 2022 will be a gloomy year for people who have difficulty making ends meet, because many households no longer have money to spend. \\\"Large groups are currently structurally stuck, such as families on social assistance, people with a low income and high rent or healthcare costs and young people who cannot find a home,\\\" says Nibud director Arjan Vliegenthart. Nibud has calculated the purchasing power development for 117 sample households. For example, a single self-employed person who earns 40,000 gross will lose 6 euros per month. View all example households here (pdf). About 550,000 Dutch households live in so-called energy poverty. They have a high energy bill, usually a poorly insulated house and a low income. This is the conclusion of research organization TNO, based on 2019 figures from Statistics Netherlands for more than 6.1 million households. TNO has not only conducted research into the nature and extent of the problem, but has also measured for the first time where various forms of energy poverty mainly occur in the Netherlands. \\\"Contrary to expectations, we mainly see energy poverty outside the Randstad: in the north, east and southeast of the country and partly in Zeeland,\\\" says Peter Mulder, lead researcher at TNO. \\\"There you have relatively many people with a low income and houses where, so to speak, the wind blows through the room.\\\" According to Mulder, to gain a better insight into energy poverty, we should not only look at the affordability of the energy bill, which could rise sharply this year. The quality of the home also plays a role, as does the extent to which residents can make their homes more sustainable. TNO distinguishes two groups. On the one hand, there are tenants of poorly insulated houses who cannot do anything about it, because the landlord is responsible for sustainability. On the other hand, there are owners of \\\"energy-guzzling\\\" houses who do not have the money to invest in a more economical house. TNO has previously conducted research into energy poverty, but in a different way than now. Last time it was a literature review. This time, data from Statistics Netherlands was used and not only the affordability of the energy bill was examined, but also the quality of the homes and the extent to which residents can make their homes more sustainable. It is therefore difficult to compare these figures with the results of previous years. \\\"Our research shows that almost half of households live in an insufficiently insulated house and cannot do much about it. A large proportion of them currently have no problem paying their energy bill. But if the gas price continues to rise, increases, some of the households in this group may still experience payment problems,\\\" Mulder warns. According to TNO, accelerating the energy transition helps to combat energy poverty. \\\"By making more homes more sustainable with a targeted policy now, we can prevent more households from running into problems and help get the energy transition underway,\\\" says Mulder. The more than half a million households living in energy poverty represent approximately 7 percent of the total number of households. By comparison: income poverty occurs in about 15 percent of all households. According to TNO, energy poverty and income poverty are related, but the phenomena do not always coincide. Researcher Mulder: \\\"Energy poverty is more concentrated. In just five municipalities and 7 percent of the neighborhoods, more than 10 percent of households are energy poor. This makes targeted policy per municipality or region easier.\\\" Curious to what extent there is energy poverty in your municipality? In the study, TNO has detailed the levels of energy poverty per municipality, district and neighborhood for the first time. That interactive map can be found here. Good morning! The House of Representatives continues to discuss budget plans for next year and the United States returns the Gilgamesh tablet, a stolen art treasure, to an Iraqi museum. But first the weather.

That has never happened before at TU Eindhoven. He pursued a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering, and during one of his electives discovered that he enjoyed teaching and was very interested in the direction of safety in technology. That made choosing a master's degree so difficult that he opted for the master's degree in Electrical Engineering, but also Information Security Technology, and Science Education and Communication. Friends and family thought Lauret was crazy when he told them about his plans, but after perseverance and hard studying, he completed his master's degree within three years. Happy Thursday! Dutch climate policy must be significantly tightened in all areas in order to meet the new European climate goals. In addition, a change in policy is also necessary in some areas. This is evident from an analysis by the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL), at the request of the House of Representatives and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate. \\\"It actually means that all plans that were already there will reach people more quickly. Making homes more sustainable will have to happen sooner than was thought and the switch to electric cars may also come closer more quickly,\\\" says Michiel Hekkenberg of the Planning Bureau. The PBL immediately adds that the proposals could still change considerably when the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament discuss them. In July, European Commissioner Frans Timmermans presented the new European climate plans, under the name 'Fit for 55'. This referred to the percentage of 55 percent by which Europe wants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. The Planning Bureau now points out in the analysis 'Netherlands fit for 55?' that the proposals are partly in line with current Dutch policy, but partly not yet. The proposals should ensure that the pace of emissions reduction across the European Union is significantly accelerated. PBL writes: \\\"The package proposes changes to almost all important pillars of climate and energy policy.\\\" The EU is committed to making CO2 emissions increasingly expensive, setting stricter standards and imposing binding targets for the member states. International aviation and shipping must also take part and contribute more than has been the case so far. The new targets mean a significant tightening of approximately fifteen megatonnes for houses, cars, agriculture and light industry in the Netherlands. The Netherlands must also focus more on energy savings and renewable energy. The committee does not indicate how the distribution should be among those sectors. That is up to the member states to decide for themselves, says Hekkenberg. \\\"But the task is so great that it is difficult to imagine that one of the sectors will be left out.\\\" The plans therefore not only mean a tightening of the current policy, but also a policy change in some parts. For example, the European Commission wants the Member States to pay specific attention to energy poverty. This means that people who do not have enough money to make sustainable investments in their home are helped. In the Netherlands, this has so far been achieved through general income and purchasing power policy. \\\"The Commission says that you must now take this into account in your climate policy. And, for example, you must give priority to making social rental housing more sustainable, so that people do not end up in such a trap,\\\" says Hekkenberg. The European plans would also mean a change of course for part of the industry in the Netherlands. \\\"The industry is being asked to use green hydrogen, which is made directly from sustainable electricity. The Commission seems to want to skip the step that the Netherlands is now focusing on,\\\" Hekkenberg explains. In the Netherlands, the current idea is to use hydrogen for the time being, which is made from natural gas, after which the released CO2 is captured and stored underground. The Planning Bureau questions this desired change of course. \\\"The question is whether the quantity of hydrogen required for this can also be produced in time. There is currently almost no production of green hydrogen in the Netherlands. The quantities that the Commission is talking about would mean a huge acceleration. So you can wonder whether a middle path would not be a wiser course.\\\" The plans also mean good news for the industry, says Hekkenberg. \\\"The task is being significantly increased for all countries in Europe. This means that, for example, industry, which was given an additional task in the climate agreement including a CO2 tax, will also have to become more sustainable in the rest of Europe. This creates a level playing field in the EU.\\\" Due to rising energy prices, millions of households could face a significant increase in their bills. That worried the House of Representatives. That is why it was decided on Thursday during the General Political Reflections to reduce household energy costs by 375 million euros. The question is whether that will make a difference. The energy bill of every household is different, but with average consumption, approximately one third consists of energy taxes. These will therefore be reduced by 375 million euros. The Ministry of Economic Affairs, responsible for the reduction, does not yet know how this will affect households. On the one hand, the tax on electricity (ODE) is reduced and on the other hand, the discount that everyone receives on energy tax is increased. Not only the eight million Dutch households but also companies seem to benefit from the reduction in energy costs because they also pay this tax and receive a discount. It is not clear exactly how this reduction will be distributed. If the reduction is divided equally among households alone, this will save approximately four euros per year per household. Statistics Netherlands calculated that at the beginning of 2021, a household with an average consumption spent around 1,500 euros per year on energy costs. But because gas prices have risen sharply, someone who now takes out a new annual contract pays about five hundred euros more. Given the increased prices, the reduction currently has a limited effect. It is uncertain whether gas prices will remain this high. For example, a warm winter could reduce demand. The Consumers' Association is pleased that attention is being paid to high energy costs. \\\"It is a nice gesture and a quick band-aid. If you want to do something about the high energy prices, you cannot avoid such a measure, but you will at least help people with it.\\\" According to the association, it is better to help people structurally by insulating houses. The government also announced on Tuesday that it would allocate 1.3 billion euros to making homes and buildings more sustainable, half a billion of which for a national insulation program. Like the Consumers' Association, professor of energy transition at Hanze University of Applied Sciences Groningen Martien Visser questions the effectiveness of the reduction. \\\"This actually does nothing about energy poverty. The money does not only go to the people who need it most. It is more of a candy for everyone, while the real concern lies with people with poorly insulated houses.\\\" A study published yesterday by research agency TNO showed that 550,000 Dutch households live in so-called energy poverty. They have a high energy bill, usually a poorly insulated house and a low income. They spend 13-20 percent of their income on energy, compared to 5 percent on average for all households. Peter Mulder, researcher at TNO: \\\"This tax reduction is a plaster on the wound, but it does not heal the wound. It is better to tackle excessively high energy bills by improving homes, by insulating.\\\" In addition to insulation, the Consumers' Association also advocates a structural reduction in energy taxes for small consumers. Large consumers, or large companies, pay proportionately much less tax than households. \\\"That has to change,\\\" says director Sandra Molenaar. \\\"By increasing the burden on the biggest polluters, you encourage them to take saving measures.\\\" The OECD, an organization of mainly rich countries, wrote this year that energy tax reductions for large companies slow down the energy transition. The ratio between energy taxes paid by small and large companies has been improved by the House of Representatives. On Thursday it was also decided to reduce the energy tax on electricity (ODE) for companies by 125 million euros. This will make taxes relatively cheaper for small and medium-sized businesses. Electricity will also become cheaper compared to gas, which should encourage SMEs to switch away from gas. Even with a large sum of money and extra attention, it is not possible to transform an old, poor working-class neighborhood into a modern urban neighborhood where it is good to live in a few years. This is evident in Oud-Crooswijk in Rotterdam, five years ago the poorest neighborhood in the Netherlands according to the Social and Cultural Planning Office (SCP). The municipality made 9 million euros available, opened a youth desk and arranged family coaches. But the district is only slowly recovering and the number of complaints about the outdoor space remains high. \\\"Doesn't anyone from the municipality see that it's a mess?\\\" a resident asks the regional broadcaster Rijnmond. According to her, every day there are household items and garbage bags next to the containers. \\\"You can't get poorer than Crooswijk,\\\" was a newspaper headline in 2016 when the SCP declared postal code '3034' the poorest district in the Netherlands. This was evident from figures on unemployment, the number of benefits, growing up in poverty, language deficiency, health and (youth) crime. The city council responded quickly. Evenings were held to hear what the residents found important. Later, 9 million euros were made available to take measures, equivalent to 1,100 euros per Crooswijk resident. If you look at the figures, small steps forward have been made since then, Rijnmond concludes. The number of benefits is decreasing. There are more people with a paid job or volunteer work. The Cito scores at primary school have improved. The number of early school leavers has fallen from 14 to 9 percent. The nuisance caused by young people on the street is decreasing and there are fewer high impact crimes (home burglary, robberies, muggings and violent crimes). Yet in 2021, Oud-Crooswijk is still one of the poorest neighborhoods in Rotterdam and the Netherlands. Many people still have difficulty making ends meet, children grow up in poverty and there are language problems. And the effects of the corona pandemic are not even known yet. There are signs that many families are having a hard time due to financial worries and tensions within the home, says PvdA councilor Roos Vermeij during a visit to the neighborhood. \\\"Who could have imagined five years ago that we would be in lockdown for a year and a half. That will have a negative impact. We will need a longer breath. That means we will continue.\\\" \\\"It takes a lot of time,\\\" Vermeij notes: It is a good idea to pay extra attention to Oud-Crooswijk in the coming years, says local resident and organizer of the Crooswijk neighborhood campsite Rafael Krijgsman. He does advise to listen carefully to the residents in the coming years and not to focus on \\\"upgrading\\\" the neighborhood. By this he refers to the tendency of municipalities to demolish social housing and replace it with new, often expensive owner-occupied houses. In theory, this will reduce poverty. But in his neighborhood it could be counterproductive, Krijgsman fears: \\\"Sometimes neighborhood bonds are broken too rigorously when renovating. That should not happen in Oud-Crooswijk.\\\" To get into the Quote 500 you need a capital of at least 95 million euros and in its counterpart, the Quiet 500, published today, the richest person portrayed has a disposable capital of 125 euros per week. It is the first time in five years that a glossy has been launched in which an attempt is made to portray people in poverty. One of the people portrayed is Larissa (34). Partly due to mistakes at the UWV and the Tax Authorities, she ended up in debt assistance and had to live on 50 euros a week. At that time, her parents paid for the diapers for her youngest child. \\\"I didn't expect at all that I would have my story published so openly. Normally you are ashamed of that. But it was done to us and maybe by telling my story I can help other people so that they don't wait so long for help.\\\" to search.\\\" Even though she is in the Quiet 500, she does not feel poor. \\\"On paper we are poor, but I don't feel poor. When I go to the forest with my children and my husband, look for chestnuts, or we can go to the beach, that for me is wealth; not how much money is in the bank stands.\\\" Initiator Ralf Embrechts hopes that by writing the stories, people will not only look to the government to tackle poverty. \\\"The gap between rich and poor is only increasing. The government knows what it can do about poverty, by coming up with decent legislation, by solving the benefits circus in a decent way. But we also call on people to take action themselves, including in your own square meter. You can do something for your neighbor.\\\" In recent years he has built communities in various cities with the Quiet organization. People help each other there, for example with items or outings that companies donate. There are now eleven in the Netherlands, reaching around 10,000 people. In the coming years he wants to expand the number of cities by dozens. The proceeds from the glossy are used for those communities. The glossy will be in stores and sent to millionaires who are in the Quote 500. Larissa is waiting to see how people will respond to her story. \\\"I have learned not to expect much. Then it can only turn out better than expected.\\\" According to the latest figures from Statistics Netherlands, just over 1 million people in the Netherlands live below the poverty line. 391,000 people in this group have been in poverty for more than 4 years. The number of poor people fell slightly before the corona crisis. What has happened to poverty in the Netherlands since the corona crisis has not yet been measured. Due to rising energy prices, millions of households would expect significant increases in their energy bills. During the general reflections, the outgoing cabinet promised to reserve 375 million to ease the costs for citizens. But experts say this is not enough to offset ever-rising energy bills. Hugo Erken, economist at Rabobank, doubts whether the millions are enough. \\\"I think politicians will have to look at further measures to compensate the energy bill.\\\" The National Institute for Budget Information (Nibud) also advocates more political measures to compensate for energy bills. \\\"On the one hand, low incomes and social assistance must be increased, so that people with low incomes spend proportionately less on their energy bills,\\\" says Gabrielle Bettonville. \\\"On the other hand, energy prices must be reduced. This can be done, for example, by doing something about excise duties.\\\" These solutions are necessary because, according to NIBUD, this is a structural problem. \\\"It's about the people who have a net deficit every month. Now it's the energy price, but next time it will be rising healthcare costs. Low incomes and the benefits system need to be structurally changed.\\\" According to calculations by Rabobank, the energy bill of an average household will increase by about 900 euros next year. \\\"Houses now pay around 1,500 to 1,600 euros in energy, of which 1,000 euros in gas,\\\" says Erken. \\\"If an additional 900 euros is added, it will be difficult for many households to afford.\\\" \\\"It is precisely the low-income group that spends a relatively large amount of money on gas and energy bills,\\\" Bettonville warns. \\\"Some households spend more than 10 percent of their budget on energy bills. This will become much more with these rising prices. This can lead to financial problems.\\\" Almost half of all Dutch households live in a poorly or moderately insulated house, without being able to do anything about it. This may be because people rent and are dependent on their landlord for sustainability; or because homeowners do not have the money to invest in their home. This is evident from research by TNO earlier this year. Only part of all those households live in energy poverty: 550,000 households, about 7 percent of all households, have high energy costs, usually live in a house that is not well insulated and have a low income. Within this group, half have a relatively low income and a home with low energy quality and high energy costs. Moreover, TNO estimates that there are 140,000 households with so-called 'hidden energy poverty': these are people who consume less energy than they would like due to financial problems. This map shows what percentage of households in each municipality live in energy poverty: In their research, TNO predicts that if the gas price continues to rise, some of the households in this group will still have a payment problem. \\\"We can prevent this by making more homes more sustainable with targeted policy now,\\\" the researchers write. The price of gas has now risen even further, the chance of an increase in payment problems is increasing, and there is no new targeted policy yet from the outgoing cabinet. The consumer association previously said it was pleased with the attention paid to the high energy bill and the government's compensation. According to the association, it is even better to help people structurally by insulating houses. \\\"You could reduce the energy tax once,\\\" Erken suggests, \\\"but that would remove the incentive to become more sustainable. You could also consider a compensation scheme for households that are having a hard time. But I think how much money you need then difficult to say. If we had started the energy transition earlier, we would not have had to make these difficult political choices. In the transition period from fossil to renewable fuels, gas is the cleanest fossil fuel to cover peak moments.\\\" Due to high energy prices, energy suppliers are forced to increase their rates. Those who have a variable contract can expect a price increase in January. Some suppliers are already bringing this price increase forward. A few energy companies even want to unilaterally break contracts with customers. For example, a small player in the energy market has asked customers by letter to agree to a significant rate increase. Customers who had fixed their rate for a year have also been notified. If customers do not agree with the unilateral termination of their contract, they are \\\"free to terminate the contract\\\". The NOS contacted two energy suppliers who are breaking contracts, but they were not available for comment. These are small companies, with several thousand customers. The Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) has received \\\"several reports\\\" of companies that unilaterally break contracts and is now investigating them. Whether rules are violated depends on the type of contract, the ACM says. The Consumers' Association is more certain: in principle, permanent contracts may not be terminated unilaterally. \\\"Some companies cite the lack of direct debit or late payment as a reason for termination. That is not allowed,\\\" says spokesperson Joyce Donat. According to the association, there is little room in the law for extreme situations. The question is to what extent a company should take price changes into account and whether breaking a contract is therefore permitted. Donat foresees exciting times: \\\"If this is allowed, it will bankrupt the market. Consumers will then no longer be able to rely on contracts with fixed rates.\\\" Small discounters often have smaller buffers and smaller margins. The risks are greater for them. \\\"I don't have a crystal ball, but I think bankruptcies of small energy companies are realistic,\\\" says Donat. \\\"You see that there are smaller energy companies that increase rates in the meantime. That may be sensible business operations, but that does not make it fun for customers.\\\" Consumers who accept the price increase from their energy company must hope that the company does not go bankrupt. In the summer you often pay a deposit for the winter. Donat: \\\"In the event of bankruptcy, that money is gone.\\\" The group on whom rate increases will have the greatest impact are households living in so-called energy poverty. In total, there are approximately 550,000 households in the Netherlands that can barely afford the higher energy bills. Not all of them have a variable energy contract or a contract that will expire soon, so only a small proportion will experience rate increases. The National Institute for Budget Information (Nibud) foresees financial problems for these households. Consumers who now switch energy companies will pay significantly more for gas and electricity. This is because energy companies purchase the gas they sell to consumers well in advance. If you enter into a contract for one or more years, the energy company will purchase the energy you will need for that period. And that price is currently high, with serious consequences for the amount of your new energy bill. Customers who are given the choice by their energy company to accept higher rates or otherwise switch have their backs against the wall. \\\"People are dependent on the energy companies. Even if a contract is broken or canceled, you need gas and electricity,\\\" says Donat. \\\"That energy will only be available at high rates if you switch suppliers now.\\\" The vast majority of people purchase their energy or gas from one of the big three: Essent, Eneco or Vattenfall. Last year these companies accounted for three quarters of the market. These companies do not have to pass on the high prices one by one. They have buffers to absorb price fluctuations. An earlier version of this article contained a video in which an affected consumer said that the price he paid for gas was originally 0.19 euros per m3. That's a mistake; it turned out to be 0.76 euros per m3. He himself calls the increase still significant, but less significant than he first thought. The video has been removed. According to MP Omtzigt, the intended cuts in child benefits will lead to more poverty among families that are already not well off. That is why the plan should be scrapped, he believes. The government wants to save on child benefit by not indexing the amount in 2022 and 2023 and less in 2024. Indexing means: adjusting to inflation (price increases). The plan assumes inflation of 1.4 percent. But it seems to be higher; Inflation currently stands at 2.7 percent. According to the cabinet, the measure should raise 100 million euros to, among other things, improve the information and communication systems of the UWV and the Social Insurance Bank. According to Omtzigt, with current inflation, 100 million will already be reached after 1 year, and it is therefore unnecessary not to index for 2.5 years. In addition, the MP calculates that the intended measure will lead to a loss of purchasing power of half a percent for people with a low income. People with lower incomes are relatively hit hardest by the cuts, because child benefit is a fixed amount per quarter. \\\"The Netherlands has relatively high poverty among families with children, because we have very meager child arrangements,\\\" says Omtzigt. \\\"That's why cutting child benefits is simply a bad idea.\\\" Normally, child benefit is adjusted twice a year to the rising costs of living. Child benefit amounts now vary from 225 to 321 euros per quarter, depending on the age of the child. Omtzigt believes that the plan should be scrapped, but if it is implemented, it will be in a watered-down form. According to the MP, in that case indexation must start again as soon as the amount of 100 million euros has been received. The plan will be discussed in the House of Representatives next Wednesday. Greenhouse horticulture is one of the largest gas consumers in the Netherlands. According to Statistics Netherlands, the sector is responsible for about 9 percent of total gas consumption in the Netherlands. Economists do not expect that high gas prices will lead to a recession for the economy as a whole, but price increases will be hard for greenhouse horticulture, among others. This month many vegetable, flower and plant growers are making a choice: plant or not? If gas prices stay this high, they will make huge losses. But also with empty greenhouses. A number of growers have already chosen not to take any risks with these high gas prices and to leave greenhouses empty, says trade organization Glastuinbouw Nederland. Energy costs make up around 30 percent of the total costs for the average greenhouse horticulturist, says Alexander Formsma of Glastuinbouw Nederland. \\u201cEven when growers have locked in a large portion of gas prices, the variable portion has become so expensive that they are overwhelmed by costs.\\u201d Greenhouse horticulture has done a lot to make it more sustainable, but it remains an energy-intensive industry in a cold country. And how cold the winter gets will also determine how much extra heating costs growers have to incur. That will probably also affect the price. Glastuinbouw Nederland expects that high gas prices will lead to more expensive tomatoes, cucumbers, roses and chrysanthemums, but cannot yet estimate how much more expensive that will be. Chrysanthemum grower Wouter Duijvesteijn fears that his flowers will become two to three times more expensive due to high gas prices: Duijvesteijn is already taking measures to ensure that the cost price remains reasonable, he says. But because in the flower growing industry schedules are set months in advance and he also has contracts to supply chrysanthemums, the options are limited. Other energy-intensive sectors will also be hit hard by these prices, such as companies in the chemical, steel, fertilizer, cement, paper and glass industries. The extent of the consequences will depend on whether gas prices remain high. Last week, the price of gas shot up to 120 euros per megawatt hour, making the price about eight times higher than a year earlier. On Monday the price had already fallen to around 90 euros per megawatt hour, but that is still a doubling in two months. Marieke Blom, chief economist at ING, doubts whether gas prices will remain high. \\\"That chance is not that great. Supply and demand are approximately in balance. The high price could be explained by hoarding behavior.\\\" The consequences for the economy also seem to be less than expected, according to Blom. \\\"The aluminum company Aldel stopping production is an appealing example, but it is only one company. You can hope that large consumers have hedged against the high prices.\\\" A factor in this is that the Netherlands is primarily a knowledge economy, of which industry makes up a relatively small part. ING, but also ABN Amro, have hardly adjusted their economic expectations for next year. The economic prospects are still good according to economists and high gas prices are only an inhibiting factor. If the gas price remains high, 44 percent of households will face a rate increase in January because they have a variable contract. This will hit households in energy poverty hard, but many households also saved a lot during corona last year. Blom: \\\"That is why the direct economic consequences are not too bad. These households do not have to consume less, but can draw on their savings.\\\" The government wants to do something about the rising energy bill with 'targeted measures'. After consultation with the most involved ministers, outgoing minister Blok said that the cabinet takes the problem very seriously and that people can receive \\\"really very hefty bills\\\". Due to rising gas prices, energy bills are likely to increase by tens of euros per month in the coming winter. Blok said that the options will be worked out in the near future to help both households and companies and at least \\\"absorb some of the price increases\\\". The measures should mainly reach people who really need them. But the outgoing minister emphasized that the interventions must be feasible and that this is complex, because there is no direct connection between the amount of income and the amount of the energy bill. \\u201cYou want to reach people for whom it matters most. But you can have low-income people who live in a well-insulated house or middle-income people who happen to live in a poorly insulated house.\\u201d The ministries most involved have formed a kind of crisis team. A long list of possibilities has already been devised. For example, it is examined whether citizens and companies can be compensated through income or energy tax. Temporary VAT reductions are also being considered. Blok emphasized that the amounts involved are large, both for those involved and for the treasury. The government has already allocated extra money for insulation on Budget Day and there may be an extra 'impulse'. According to the minister, this can be done by increasing amounts, but also by ensuring that isolations can be carried out more quickly. The government may announce what measures it is taking on Friday. But Blok said it could also be a little later. In 35 years, the purchasing power of Dutch people has increased by 58 percent. This is evident from a major study by Statistics Netherlands (CBS) and Leiden University, which includes revised data on Dutch incomes from recent decades. Income inequality increased in the period from 1977 to 1990, but in the almost 20 years that followed, inequality remained virtually the same. \\\"Dutch households have generally made good progress, without this being at the expense of rising inequality,\\\" says chief economist Peter Hein van Mulligen (CBS). The research does state that inequality in the Netherlands is quite high. \\\"There are still a million people living below the poverty line. I can imagine that people think that is too many, but in the past there were many more.\\\" The research shows that this stability in the distribution of wealth is due to reforms in the tax system. For example, the tax and premium burden fell from 44 percent in 1985 to 38.2 percent in 2019. This has left people with more disposable income. Benefits such as the AOW and supplementary pensions also have a strong redistributive effect. Have income differences in the Netherlands increased or decreased since 1990? And are more or fewer people living in poverty? The answers are surprising to many people, Nieuwsuur found out. Students and people with social benefits are mainly in the lowest income group. Self-employed people are often found in the bottom and top groups, because they can make a relatively large profit but can also suffer large losses. Employees usually have a middle or high income. Seniors are more often in the low and middle income groups. The share of income earned by the top 1 percent has remained fairly stable over the past 40 years. The share of top incomes has grown in many other countries over the past four decades, particularly in Anglo-Saxon countries, the report says. In 2019, there was no other country where the income share of top earners was as low as in the Netherlands. \\\"I think that is one of the most striking findings. The stability that we see in the Netherlands is not there in other countries. In the United States or even in Germany, the share of top incomes has increased,\\\" says Van Mulligen. Statistics Netherlands uses the internationally recognized Gini coefficient to measure income inequality. With a Gini coefficient of 0, each household has the same income. With a coefficient of 1, one household has all the income. The probability of poverty has fallen on average since 1977. \\\"That is because labor participation has increased. Working is the best remedy to do something about poverty. Those who work and are still below the poverty line, work very little and often in insecure contracts,\\\" says Van Mulligen. Another group that sometimes falls below the poverty line are self-employed people who have had a bad year. \\\"They can live on their reserves, but due to the falling income they are included in poverty in such a bad year. People who are still at risk of poverty afterwards are mainly people on social assistance,\\\" says Van Mulligen. As many as three quarters of the people receiving benefits are below the poverty line. In the past, many retirees were also below the poverty line, but that has changed. \\\"Previously, with the AOW you were below the poverty line,\\\" says Van Mulligen. In the 1990s, state pensioners made up a quarter of the people below the poverty line. The state pension has been increased since 2000. \\\"As a result, there were almost no pensioners below the poverty line anymore. Those who were below it did not fully build up their state pension rights, for example because they lived abroad. If you do not have supplementary pensions, there is a good chance that you are below poverty line,\\\" says Van Mulligen. The purchasing power of retirees increased for decades, but has actually fallen over the past ten years. Over the past ten years there has been a loss of purchasing power of almost 5 percent. This was mainly because pension benefits were not or hardly indexed in these years. The decision to allocate 2.7 billion euros to compensate consumers' higher energy bills due to the sharply rising gas price is a hasty one, experts believe. They anticipate that high income earners will benefit from this scheme. The money will, among other things, reduce energy taxes and a small part, 150 million, is intended for insulating homes. The budget institute Nibud is pleased with the government's step. \\\"We think it is very good that the response is so quick,\\\" says a spokesperson. \\\"But we still have to see whether it is enough for the people who will soon have to pay 900 euros more.\\\" The government expects that the scheme will save households on average around 400 euros. Peter Mulder, Energy Studies researcher at TNO, also understands very well that the government is coming up with the compensation. \\\"This is perhaps the best thing the government can do in this situation. This will help people with payment problems in the short term.\\\" But according to Marieke Blom, chief economist at ING, that is precisely where this measure fails. The compensation applies to everyone, regardless of income. \\\"The fact that a generic measure has now been chosen will mean that households with high incomes will also mainly benefit from this, while they have actually improved in terms of savings during the corona crisis.\\\" The government has considered compensation schemes that would mainly benefit households with lower incomes. \\\"Precisely because we have opted for a broad measure, some of it will also end up with people who do not need it,\\\" says outgoing minister Yesilg\\u00f6z. \\\"But it had to be implemented properly and quickly, a more complicated measure would take too much time.\\\" According to Blom, there were possibilities. \\\"95 percent of the money goes where it shouldn't go. For example, if you had done something for lower incomes it would have been better. It concerns such a small group compared to the entire amount. Even with very high implementation costs, it was it turned out better than if you did it generically.\\\" Economist Pieter Gautier, affiliated with the Vrije Universiteit of Amsterdam, calls the measure \\\"clumsy and a waste of money\\\" if the money does not reach the households that mainly need it. He sees another side effect. \\\"This compensation measure removes the incentive to save energy by insulating and or living smaller. If the energy price remains high or rises further, the government will continue to compensate.\\\" Mulder from TNO also believes that the entire amount could have been better spent on insulating houses. \\\"With that amount you could have insulated many houses, and thus eliminate a significant part of energy poverty.\\\" The government continues to reflexively compensate and absorb costs, as during the corona crisis, Blom observes. \\\"As an economist, I say that you should only do this type of policy if it would otherwise have a very large domino effect. And that is not the case in this case.\\\" That is why she calls for the cabinet to reconsider compensation. \\\"First see whether those gas prices remain so high, the expected price for April and March is already much lower. And take the time until at least the end of the year to arrive at a more targeted approach. After January 1, 44 percent of the households only notice what it means for them when they have to conclude a new energy contract,\\\" says Blom. The outgoing government will compensate households for the sharply rising gas price through tax measures, it was announced yesterday. But even with this compensation of around four hundred euros per household, your energy bill could be higher next year. A lot also depends on your energy contract. But you largely have control over how much gas you use and therefore how much you have to pay each month. That is why we have listed all kinds of tips for the lowest possible gas consumption, which will cost you little or no money. The tips have been compiled based on information from consultancy organization Milieu Centraal and Energiebank Rotterdam, a foundation that helps people with a low income to reduce energy costs. The vast majority of your gas consumption goes to heating and hot water, say Milieu Centraal and the Energy Bank. So adjusting your cooking behavior yields little benefit. But if you really want to use as little gas as possible, you can still do the following: In order to get more women to participate in the cervical cancer screening programme, a self-test must be included. This is an equivalent alternative to the smear test at the GP, according to an advice from the Health Council. Such a self-sampling test makes it easier for women to participate in the population screening. Women who are dreading a smear test at the GP can be motivated to still participate. This allows more cases of cervical cancer to be detected early. Women between the ages of 30 and 60 receive a call once every five years to participate in the cervical cancer screening program. The self-sampling test has been available since 2017 if women find it annoying to have a smear test taken by their GP. If the test is included, the threshold for participation will be significantly lowered, the council expects. Women who have no problems with a smear test also have the option to do the test at home. This allows women to collect and send material from their vagina themselves. It is important that women participate in the research, says chairman of the Health Council Bart Jan Kullberg in the NOS Radio 1 Journaal. And the test is very simple. \\\"A container with a plastic brush in it, twist it a few times in the vagina, a simple test, and then send it.\\\" The laboratory tests for the HPV virus. Certain types of this human papillomavirus pose a high risk of developing cervical cancer. The virus is also sexually transmitted. If the result of the self-sampling test is positive, a smear test must still be taken by your GP. The advice comes after a renewal of the test in 2017. Before then, the material was tested for abnormalities in the cells of the cervix. Since 2017, testing has first been carried out for the presence of the harmful types of the HPV virus. KWF Cancer Control agrees with the advice. Linda Summer from KWF: \\\"50 percent respond to the call and that is even lower between the ages of 30 and 40. I hope this will increase. We call on you to participate, it can save your life.\\\" Every year, 200 women die from cervical cancer, she says. 800 women get it. \\\"Girls can be vaccinated, but that is no reason not to respond to the research. Vaccination protects 75 percent.\\\" Participation in the population survey was already low before 2017. About 65 percent of the women responded to the call. Since 2017, that percentage has fallen to 56 percent. The cause of this is unclear. 11 percent of the women who participated in the study requested the self-sampling test. Of those who tested positive and were called to have a swab test taken, almost 10 percent did not respond. Due to the renewal of screening, more women are being found with cervical cancer and its precursors. On the other hand, since then more women have been referred to the gynecologist who subsequently turn out not to have cervical cancer (or precancerous ones). \\\"They are unfairly worried and burdened with additional research, sometimes it even leads to unnecessary operations,\\\" says Kullberg. \\\"Which women should be referred is a matter of evolving insight.\\\" The Health Council advises using more specific criteria for referral to the gynaecologist. \\\"An innocent form of the virus does not have to lead to this. But with troubled cells you will always be forwarded.\\\" The council also recommends investigating whether computer-assisted screening can be used, a method in which the assessment of abnormal cells is partly automated. Cervical cancer mainly occurs in women between the ages of 35 and 45. Since 2009, girls have been able to be vaccinated against the HPV virus and since 2019, boys have also been able to do so. Women who are reluctant to have a smear test taken by their GP should soon be able to discover whether they may have cervical cancer through a self-test, the Health Council advised earlier today. This allows more cases of cervical cancer to be detected early. Dagmar de Boer (30 years old) also noticed this. She first received the call last August. Half of women between the ages of 30 and 60 do not respond to the call. And that is too much, according to the Dutch Cancer Society. Two hundred women die every year from cervical cancer, says Linda Summer of KWF. Eight hundred women get it. We urge you to participate, it can save your life.\\\" De Boer chose to request a self-test instead of going to the doctor. Not because she found it uncomfortable or scary to go to the doctor for a smear test. but mainly out of convenience. \\\"I work during office hours and then it is simply easier to do such a self-test in my own time and send it in.\\\" The test is very simple, says chairman of the Health Council Bart Jan Kullberg in the NOS Radio 1 Journaal. \\\"A holder with a plastic brush in it, twist it a few times in the vagina, a simple test, and then send it in.\\\" De Boer had no complaints, which is why she was shocked when she received the results a week later She turned out to be carrying the HPV virus. \\\"Then I thought, shit, could I also have cervical cancer?\\\" NOS op 3 explains in this video what exactly the HPV virus is: The self-test can only determine whether someone carries the HPV virus, which can cause cervical cancer. \\\"After the results of the self-test, I still had to go to the doctor for a smear test. No malignant cells were found during that test.\\\" To keep a close eye on everything, she now has a smear test made by her doctor every six months. \\\"I'm just glad it was discovered early. I was just 30 years old when I had this test done, so I don't know how long it was in my body before it was discovered.\\\" That is why De Boer would prefer that the invitation for the population survey be sent to all women from the age of 20, and not only from the age of 30. \\u201cIt should become as normal as a corona self-test,\\u201d she believes. Cervical cancer mainly occurs in women between the ages of 35 and 45. Since 2009, girls have been able to be vaccinated against the HPV virus and since 2019, boys have also been able to do so. A new way of distributing 30 billion euros between municipalities is better than the current one, but still has problems. This is what the Public Administration Council (ROB) says in an advice on a new distribution key, which must be introduced in 2023. Municipalities levy taxes themselves and therefore have money to spend, but their main source of income is the so-called municipal fund. Every year, the central government distributes 30 billion euros from that fund to the municipalities. How much a municipality receives depends on all kinds of factors, and the distribution key will therefore change. The division is now based on, among other things, the number of inhabitants, the proportion of young people, the elderly, people with a low income, the soil quality, the surface area and the number of residential areas in a municipality. In the new distribution, the number of young and old people will become less important, but for the first time, for example, the education level of the residents will be taken into account. And the center function (the extent to which people from outside the municipality use services in the municipality) is becoming more important. According to the ROB, the distribution of money for social tasks is an improvement, because it does more justice to the differences in expenditure on youth care and care under the Social Support Act (WMO) between municipalities. \\\"For the social domain, the actual expenditure of municipalities has now been examined for the first time since decentralization.\\\" As a result of the new distribution, approximately 50 municipalities will lose more than 60 euros per inhabitant annually and around 40 municipalities will gain more than 60 euros, the ROB calculates. This is partly justified, the Council believes. \\\"There are municipalities that are somewhat over-allocated in the current system. And there are others where this new distribution does more justice to the needs of the population.\\\" But according to the Council, the redistribution is taking hold. \\\"The financial consequences for a large number of municipalities raise questions.\\\" In particular, municipalities of around 70,000 inhabitants and less with not such a strong center function and an aging population are declining, cities such as Schiedam, Den Helder, Hoorn and Enkhuizen. \\\"These are typical municipalities with a population that needs a lot of care from the municipality, but where that care need may not be sufficiently met.\\\" According to the Council, these municipalities may soon have to cut back on, for example, green maintenance and subsidies for sports and culture in order to have sufficient money left over for their social tasks. There is a profit for cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants and with a central function: places such as Tilburg, Enschede and Nijmegen. According to the Council, the four largest cities (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht) will not make any additional progress, because they already received an extra amount in the current system, due to the accumulation of big city problems and extra tasks they had compared to other municipalities. That extra for the G4 will disappear, but they will receive more money because of their center function. This year, outgoing Minister of the Interior Ollongren proposed a new distribution key and asked the ROB for advice on it. \\\"We advise the minister to first investigate any unintended adverse effects before the new distribution can be introduced,\\\" the Council now says. It is likely that a new cabinet will only decide on the final distribution key. And the plan was to introduce the new distribution step by step, with the amount per inhabitant for a municipality decreasing or increasing by a maximum of 15 euros annually. The Council believes that the redistribution should stop after three years, so that municipalities gain or lose a maximum of 45 euros per inhabitant. And then the method of distribution would have to be reconsidered. The main criticism of the Association of Dutch Municipalities (VNG) was earlier that the 30 billion euros is not enough anyway and that municipalities need more money to carry out their tasks. The VNG will probably provide a response to the distribution key in December. In this advice, the Council only looked at the distribution, not whether 30 billion euros is enough at all. Churches want to help distribute the 2.7 billion euros that the government has allocated to compensate for the sharply rising gas price more fairly. The outgoing cabinet announced two weeks ago that every household, regardless of income, will receive about 400 euros. But there are also households that do not need that money, says the national Council of Churches. During the announcement earlier this month, the government said that it had considered compensation schemes that would mainly benefit households with lower incomes. But according to State Secretary Yesilg\\u00f6z, this would make implementing the measure complicated and compensation for everyone was therefore chosen. At the initiative of a church in Ommen, Dutch churches are working on a plan so that people who do not need the amount can donate it to a local church fund. \\\"People with a tight budget can then claim this themselves,\\\" said Christien Crouwel, general secretary of the Council of Churches in the NOS Radio 1 Journaal. \\\"We have been doing this for years, raising and redistributing money. That is actually the purpose of deacons and church funds.\\\" To use the fund, people do not have to be or become a member of the church. \\\"That is never the approach of church resources,\\\" says Crouwel. It will take some time before people can actually make use of the scheme. \\\"We are now looking into how local governments can arrange this from a tax perspective. And it is a challenge to reach the people who desperately need this. That is why we are looking for collaboration with local governments and organizations such as the food bank to use the available knowledge and resources.\\\" For years, the Tax Authorities were able to continue with fraud lists containing 270,000 people, according to a report by the Dutch Data Protection Authority. The consequences are not yet known for all cases. The Ministry of Finance has already announced that approximately 5,000 to 15,000 people on the blacklist have experienced disadvantages as a result of registration. For example, a personal payment arrangement or amicable debt restructuring could be wrongly rejected. Carel Stuurman is one of those people who - without knowing it - appeared on this blacklist. He says that he still experiences many problems, mentally and financially. The report from the Dutch Data Protection Authority offers him \\\"some recognition\\\". \\\"I actually have no words for it. In my case, this situation has cost me money, but imagine that it puts your children in danger. Today I thought again: my God, how could it all happen.\\\" At the same time, according to de Castricummer, it contains nothing new. \\\"I already knew that it had affected so many people because that is the reason it is taking so long for my case to be investigated by the tax authorities. They are so busy, it cannot be otherwise.\\\" Stuurman discovered this spring that he was on the blacklist. A letter of apology fell on the mat. \\\"This confirmed what I had known for a long time. That something very strange was going on. I had problems getting a mortgage for years and had no access to debt help for a long time.\\\" According to him, the consequences were serious: \\\"I had tons of debt, which I could only pay off after years. I am still registered with the BKR, while we were neatly given a clean slate. Then such an apology letter is very nice, but we are still always concerned with survival.\\\" Manon Ortmans said she had 'no problems with anything' until she received the apology letter this year. \\\"I was completely surprised. I work for the government myself and know the systems. I could never have imagined that I would find myself in a risk-driven system.\\\" As far as she knows, the official has never experienced any inconvenience from the fact that she was on the list. \\\"But when I knew, I reported it to my new employer. I said that I didn't know how it could be, but that this was the reality.\\\" The AP report shows that privacy legislation has been grossly violated. \\\"I am in shock about this. I also work with the privacy law and am very aware of this. I think it would have prevented many problems if there had been better communication with people.\\\" Ortmans believes it is high time that other people on the list are compensated and that more research is conducted into how this could have happened. \\\"The government is at the service of the citizen, and this has not proven to be the case. That much is clear to me.\\\" Elisabeth Miguel says she has lived in poverty for years because her name is on the list. \\\"For years I had to repay rent, healthcare and childcare allowance even though I was entitled to it. The results of the report do not surprise me.\\\" What does surprise her is that the Dutch Data Protection Authority says it is still investigating whether the tax authorities will be fined. \\\"Then I think: if this had happened to an entrepreneur or a citizen, a fine would have been imposed long ago.\\\" The research also contains information about the reasons the Tax Authorities had for putting citizens on the list. \\\"Now When I read this report, it makes me think. I still do not have access to my file, but I now have suspicions.\\\" Miguel had to struggle financially for years due to the situation. When she turned to the credit bank for debt assistance, the tax authorities did not want to cooperate. \\\"I have a nice job, a good income. But the misery is not over, because because of this registration I am still registered negatively everywhere. You think: it won't happen to you, but this could happen to anyone.' Various organizations of gynecologists, abortion doctors, Rutgers Sexuality expertise center and Fiom, a foundation that advises women in unwanted pregnancies, are calling for stricter rules regarding guest lectures on abortion at secondary schools and vocational colleges. The reason for their concerns is the increasing number of organizations that give guest lectures to convince students that abortion is not good. Hundreds of young people from dozens of mainly reformed and reformed schools have received such guest lessons in recent years, according to research by NOS Stories. It is certain that ten comprehensive schools, which include a total of 42 schools, have booked guest lessons in recent years from organizations that say they are against abortion. Explicit anti-abortion noise occurs in the lessons. This concerns the organizations Scream for Life, the Dutch Patients Association and the Canadian CCBR. The organization ProLife Europe, which was founded in 2019 especially for young people, also offers guest lessons. The schools and organizations themselves confirmed this to NOS Stories, or it was visible in annual plans, agendas and on their websites and social media accounts. In some cases, information from the lessons is misleading and in some organizations demonstrably incorrect. According to Rutgers and others, it is misleading that the images of the fetuses are enlarged so that they resemble real babies and are also called that, while 85 percent of abortions are performed before 12 weeks and 60 percent when the fetus is still is an embryo. NOS Stories also came across an animation of a fetus 'crawling away' from abortion instruments in the womb - an incorrect representation of reality, experts say. The video below from NOS Stories goes into more detail about what is taught in the guest lessons. In recent weeks, NOS Stories investigated why anti-abortion voices among young people have been so prevalent in recent years. European research shows that, for the first time, young people are more conservative about abortion than their parents and organizations that are against abortion have also increasingly targeted young people in recent years through, for example, guest lectures at schools. In recent weeks, NOS Stories spoke with a number of these organizations and with several young people who are against abortion about their motivations: According to the Ministry of Education, these guest lessons are allowed. Each school is free to decide for itself which teaching package they choose or who they invite for guest lessons. \\\"Schools may organize guest lessons that reflect their foundation or identity,\\\" the ministry says. \\\"In such education, they must indicate that there are other views, and in the case of abortion, state that abortion is permitted according to the law. As mentioned, students must be guided in this education to independently form an opinion, even if this view is not matches that of the school.\\\" The education inspectorate often checks schools' plans at the beginning of the year, paying attention to 'diversity in learning about sexuality'. However, this is insufficient, according to the Rutgers Sexuality expertise center, Fiom (unwanted pregnancies expertise center), the Dutch Association for Obstetrics and Gynecology (NVOG) and the Dutch Society of Abortion Doctors (NGvA). According to them, these lessons compromise freedom of choice, partly because this would increase the taboo on abortion. For example, Ellen Giepmans of Fiom says: \\\"When people lack factually correct information, it is more difficult to make an informed choice. In addition, it increases stigmatization and condemnation of women who do choose abortion.\\\" Rutgers also calls on politicians to come up with a curriculum that specifically describes what lessons about sexuality education must meet \\\"and in which free choice in the event of unwanted or unintended pregnancy is paramount\\\". Something that Fiom, the NVOG and the NGvA also support. Conversations that NOS Stories held with various teachers and school leaders from reformed and reformed secondary schools show that there is a great need for the lessons. For example, a social science teacher who invited at least four organizations says: \\\"I think they give a balanced picture, and we have good contacts with the organizations.\\\" And a social studies section leader from another school: \\\"Organizations such as 'Scream for Life' often receive negative media coverage. We want to tell the full story and they explicitly tell us what such an abortion looks like. There is little attention in the media. for.\\\" That is exactly why ProLife Europe offers these lessons, says Wilco Kodde of that organization: \\\"We believe that other information about abortion deliberately omits information about the growth of a baby. We show that, that is how we provide the complete picture. It's a kind of biology lesson. In our guest lectures we don't share incorrect information, we just share the facts,\\\" he says. Ineke van der Vlugt of Rutgers: \\\"Politicians should ask themselves whether they consider one-sided lessons, sometimes even misleading information about abortion, desirable. What do we want to teach children? Abortion without judgement. That it is a right, access to abortion is a human right. Students have the right to honest, correct and complete information about abortion. So that they can freely make their own choice. Whatever choice that is.\\\" Inflation rose to 3.4 percent in October, the Central Bureau of Statistics announced today. This means that the price increase for products and services is the highest since April 2002. The fact that everything is becoming more expensive is annoying for everyone, but lower incomes are generally hit hardest. \\\"Someone with a low income spends almost all their money, simply because it is necessary,\\\" says Peter Hein van Mulligen of CBS. \\\"With expenses on groceries and fixed costs such as rent, they are already close to one hundred percent of their income. So those people suffer the most when everything becomes more expensive.\\\" Inflation is mainly so high because energy, such as gas and petrol, has risen sharply in price. \\\"Energy is a basic good and lower income earners spend on average a larger share of their income on these types of basic needs,\\\" says Marieke Blom, chief economist at ING. \\\"People with a lower income also more often live in rental properties that are not always well insulated,\\\" says Van Mulligen. This is also why they often spend a larger part of their income on gas. \\\"Not all tenants live in a draughty apartment, but they often do.\\\" Blom sees that this quickly affects people with lower incomes. \\\"And the inconvenient thing is that it is important for them to adjust expenses.\\\" \\\"I have an average income,\\\" says 27-year-old Sarah Soelman-Langenberg. \\\"But a higher energy bill also makes a big difference for my family.\\\" She had to sign a new contract last month and her monthly amount went from 70 to 210 euros. \\\"140 euros more per month, that's quite a bit of money. There should be no more unexpected expenses now, because then that will cut into our savings account.\\\" Sarah and her husband are expecting their second child soon. \\\"We no longer go out to eat or go on days out. We now leave out nice things, because we want to have enough money for extra expenses, such as diapers.\\\" The extent to which you are personally affected by higher inflation also depends on the extent to which your spending pattern corresponds to that of the average Dutch person. Because CBS calculates price increases based on the things people spend their money on on average every month. Month after month, CBS then keeps track of the prices of all these products and services. This is what we spend our money on on average. Statistics Netherlands keeps track of this in detail, swipe to see, for example, how our expenditure on clothing and shoes is broken down. \\\"Inflation can turn out very differently for individuals,\\\" says Peter Hein van Mulligen of CBS. \\\"If you don't smoke and cigarettes become more expensive, you don't notice it. But someone who smokes a pack a day really notices it.\\\" The high inflation is largely due to high energy prices, especially gas. Many people are not yet affected by this, because the high gas price mainly applies to people who had to take out a new contract in recent months. Most with a variable contract will not experience a price increase until January, and those with a permanent contract will only face a price increase when it expires. People can try to avoid inflation by reducing energy expenditure. \\\"But it is not the case that you order double glazing today and it will be installed tomorrow,\\\" says Van Mulligen. \\\"You can also wear a thick sweater and set your thermostat to 18. But that is actually also a kind of loss of prosperity, life is more comfortable in a T-shirt at 21 degrees.\\\" The question is how long energy prices will remain so high. \\\"That is difficult to predict. Also because this is an unusual period, the aftermath of the corona crisis,\\\" says Marieke Blom of ING. \\\"Yet I also say that these very high energy prices are unusual and coincidentally, 'everything is going wrong' at the moment. There are no immediate indications that this will continue next year. The futures market expects lower prices later.\\\" The Dutch ggz, the trade association for mental health care, says that it will not be possible to eliminate the long waiting lists. Chairman Ruth Peetoom says that a lot is already happening, but that we also need to look differently at how people can be helped. New figures show that 15 percent more young people have recently registered with mental health care, while people now have to wait months before they receive help. The number of adults needing psychological help has returned to its previous level after a decline during the corona period. \\\"We have about 100,000 people waiting now,\\\" Peetoom said in the NOS Radio 1 Journaal. Peetoom says that the sector can no longer do it alone. \\\"We are doing everything we can to help people. It is all hands on deck. That is why I want to make the call: let's look differently and ensure that people can be helped.\\\" The mental health care chairman is also sounding the alarm in Trouw today, calling it inevitable that there will be a debate to determine what is and is not mental health care. According to the industry, this is the only way to maintain care for the most vulnerable. The problem with waiting lists has been around for some time, but a lot is already happening, says Peetoom. \\\"We work together with health insurers and general practitioners. And there are so-called regional tables where people can consult if there is no room at a certain institution. Great successes have already been achieved in this way.\\\" Staffing problems are also piling up. Absenteeism among staff is over 6 percent and long-term absenteeism in particular is increasing. According to the Dutch Mental Health Service, an estimated 3,000 employees are ill for a long period of time. This is in addition to previous forecasts for 2021 that there is a shortage of around 3,500 to 6,800 employees. \\\"That is a problem that also occurs in other healthcare sectors,\\\" says Peetoom. The chairman also mentions the tightness on the labor market and the fact that healthcare workers have looked for another job because of the staff shortage. To combat waiting lists, discussions must also be held with municipalities, housing associations and debt assistance, says Peetoom. \\\"Many have a social background. Debts, poverty, no roof over your head, if there are problems at work, then that is not good for your mental health.\\\" Peetoom does not mean that mental health care excludes people. \\\"I mainly want to find the solution, remove things that can cause or worsen problems. And provide people with things to deal with their problems. That sounds simple, but it is not and it can really help.\\\" In total, around 30,000 people are currently waiting longer than is permitted according to the so-called Treeknorm. According to this standard, someone must be able to have an intake interview with a mental health provider within four weeks. Treatment should be possible ten weeks later. The increasing proceeds from the sale of European emission rights, which industry needs to reduce CO2 emissions, will generate approximately 14 billion euros for the Netherlands by 2030. This is the conclusion of two research agencies after research commissioned by the Dutch Sustainable Energy Association (NVDE). Over the past four years, the emission price for heavy industry has risen from 10 to 60 euros per tonne of CO2. The expectation is that the increase will continue in the coming years to at least 70 euros per tonne. The European Commission wants member states to spend all income from the sale of emission allowances on climate policy. The EU member states have yet to decide whether they will actually do this. Major polluters such as coal-fired power stations, the petrochemical industry, and the concrete and cement industry must purchase rights to emit CO2. For a long time, this system of European emission allowances (ETS) languished because there were too many allowances in circulation. By removing a surplus of 'free' allowances from the system, the system is now starting to do what it was designed to do: ensure that investments in sustainable alternatives to the polluting industry become profitable. In the meantime, the European Commission is tightening the policy, meaning that companies will have to buy more CO2 rights and the CO2 price is expected to rise further. This not only leads to fewer CO2 emissions, but also to more income for the member states of the European Union. Until now, they were not obliged to spend all that money on climate policy, but if it is up to the Commission, this will change. Dutch climate policy and sustainable energy projects are now mainly financed from the Sustainable Energy Surcharge (ODE). This energy tax - in addition to the regular energy tax - is used for subsidies that, among other things, pay for large projects with solar panels and wind turbines, but also for the capture and storage of CO2 in empty gas fields under the North Sea. The way in which the Netherlands finances climate policy is not without controversy. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development criticizes the Netherlands because small and medium-sized businesses pay the bill for the polluting industry. Major consumers such as Tata Steel and Shell receive 'major consumer discounts' on energy taxes, meaning they pay relatively little. Large consumers make more use of subsidies than small companies. Financing via the ODE also means that every additional effort on climate policy is visibly reflected in the energy bill, even for people with a low income. This reduces support for climate policy, the highest official of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate wrote in January. The Netherlands now has plans to reduce CO2 emissions by 49 percent by 2030. According to the new European standard, this should be 55 percent. To achieve that goal, new measures are required, with associated costs. According to the client, the research by the agencies Ecorys and SQ Consult shows that the budget for Dutch climate policy can be increased by 50 percent with the proceeds from the sale of CO2 emission rights. According to the NVDE, this also brings the tightened climate goals for 2030 closer. The KNVB is investigating the possibility of postponing professional football matches scheduled for the next three weeks. This is what Jan de Jong, director of Eredivisie CV, said in response to the measures announced by outgoing Prime Minister Mark Rutte on Friday. Professional football clubs may inform the association this weekend whether they want to play or prefer to postpone the matches. NAC Breda and Sparta have already indicated that they see merit in rescheduling matches. In that case, games would take place on weekday evenings and on public holidays. Spectators are not welcome in both professional and amateur sports for the next three weeks. The measure will take effect on Saturday, November 13 at 6 p.m. and will last at least until Saturday, December 4. The public is banned from both indoor and outdoor sports. Outsiders are also not allowed to attend training sessions. The match between FC Eindhoven and FC Dordrecht in the Kitchen Champion Division on Saturday is the last match where spectators are welcome for the time being. The meeting will be brought forward by half an hour. By blowing the first whistle at 4 p.m., the match in the Jan Louwers Stadium was played before six in the evening. The World Cup qualifying match between the Dutch national team and Norway will be played without an audience in the Rotterdam Kuip on Tuesday. The KNVB had already sold 44,000 tickets. On Friday, the KNVB lobbied in The Hague in vain to change the plans of the outgoing cabinet to play Premier League matches without an audience for the next three weeks. The football association issued a statement on behalf of the Eredivisie CV and the Kitchen Champion Division. The words 'dismay' and 'failed policy' were central to clarify the unanimous misunderstanding. \\\"Professional football has indicated the negative consequences of playing without an audience on a sporting and financial level,\\\" Jan de Jong said. \\\"The proposals do not lead to fewer infections or less pressure on public spaces.\\\" RKC director Frank van Mosselveld would receive Ajax in Waalwijk on November 21. The government's measures to curb a new corona wave are throwing a spanner in the works. Shortly before the press conference of the outgoing cabinet, Van Mosselveld explained his objections to playing in front of empty stands. Rutte riposted on Friday that it is first and foremost about reducing the number of contact moments between spectators around the matches. \\\"It's not just about the audience in the stands. On the way to the football stadium, people meet on the train, tram, bus and in the square in front of the entrance. We want to put an end to those movements with these measures.\\\" Professional football clubs do not agree with this. The main concern there is that the outgoing cabinet is not looking at the proven risks. All research conducted over the past year shows that audiences at football matches are not a breeding ground for infections. \\\"That has been demonstrated several times. And yet the first line is drawn by the public in professional football. In any case, this is now being discussed. This looks like policy poverty, people in The Hague no longer know what to do,\\\" he said. the statement from the KNVB. \\\"We have invested tens of thousands of euros per location to make everything corona-proof for the spectators. Hundreds of matches have been played with an audience since the first lockdown and not a single match has led to major outbreaks of corona infection. The figures from the RIVM and GGD also confirm this. \\\" \\\"We fully cooperated in the field labs and subsequently the pilots with the corona test certificate. As a result, we have gained (scientific) knowledge and experience that we could share with other sectors. We have been checking the corona admission ticket for a long time with a 100% score. and that runs smoothly in professional football.\\\" The Short Track World Cup is scheduled to take place in Dordrecht on the weekend of November 27 and 28. Just like the World Championships in March this year, there will again be 3,500 empty seats. In February 2020, the short trackers last raced in front of full stands in Dordrecht. Tournament director Cees Juffermans is disappointed with the measures. \\\"But the most important thing is that the race continues. This is an Olympic qualifying race, the prelude to next year's Winter Games in Beijing. The most important thing is that the riders do what they have to do.\\\" The organization did not have a Plan B, says Juffermans. \\\"We only saw this coming at a late stage, which is why we lack two scenarios. During the World Cup we had transformed the skating rink into a kind of television studio. That will not be the case now. It will be a matter of tapping into the adaptability and putting our shoulders to the wheel. It is what it is.\\\" The Dutch hockey men will have to play the first two matches in the FIH Pro League against Olympic champion Belgium without an audience. The matches will be played on November 26 and 28 at the HC Rotterdam complex. When checking childcare allowance fraud, the Tax Authorities mainly chose to carry out additional checks on people with a low income. The tax authorities said this to RTL Nieuws and Trouw, after both media had asked questions about it. Higher incomes were actually spared. The tax authorities used a so-called risk classification model from April 2013. Based on various indicators, it was determined who would be extra checked when applying for benefits and a self-learning algorithm was used for this. The system was taken off the air in July last year, after the publication of a critical report from KPMG. The Tax Authorities told Trouw and RTL Nieuws that there was \\\"a statistical relationship between the level of income and the chance of an (in)correct application\\\". At least since March 2016, people's income has been used \\\"with variable cut-offs\\\". This means in practice, both media write, that low incomes were seen as a higher risk than higher incomes. Research by the NOS showed in 2019 that the government used predictive algorithms on a large scale. For example, to detect fraud and crime, but also to estimate what kind of care someone needs and what the chance is that a student will leave school before his or her education is completed. Read more about that research in this article. According to the tax authorities, income had only \\\"little weight\\\" in determining the risks associated with childcare allowance. According to the Tax Authorities, the main intention was to prevent high reimbursements of allowances for low incomes. It also previously emerged that the Tax Authorities used a different indicator for applicants for childcare allowance, which meant that people without Dutch nationality had a greater chance of being wrongly labeled as fraudsters. SP MP Leijten requested at the end of last month that the entire risk classification model be made public. Outgoing State Secretary Van Huffelen says that a \\\"careful substantive response\\\" will be sent to the House of Representatives at the end of this week. Previously, Amnesty International and the Dutch Data Protection Authority, among others, expressed fierce criticism of the tax authorities' systems. NOS op 3 explains in this video what the benefits scandal entails: The Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) has failed to supervise energy supplier EnergieFlex. In addition, the Consumers' Association brought customers to the company and made money from it, while the association should have known that there were problems. Curator Willem Jan van Andel came to these conclusions in his report on the bankruptcy of EnergieFlex in 2018. The report was published at a time of unrest on the energy market. Last month, three energy companies went bankrupt, partly due to high energy prices. EnergieFlex went bankrupt three years ago, but according to the curator, that bankruptcy largely shows what is still wrong on the Dutch energy market. In 2018, EnergieFlex, also known as Flexenergie, went bankrupt. The company, founded in 2014, sold energy through a prepaid model, focusing mainly on people with low incomes. The energy supplier's accounting turned out to be far below standard. In none of the years that the company was active did the accountant issue an approved opinion on the annual accounts. A debt of millions to the tax authorities remained behind, and in addition, the affected customers no longer saw their advances. The deficit amounts to 23 million euros. Curator Van Andel focuses his criticism on three parties, first of all on the directors Sivakumar Kandiah and Sathees Sampar. They are \\\"primarily responsible for this state of affairs\\\" and their \\\"improper management\\\" is, according to the curator, an important cause of the bankruptcy. According to Van Andel, the revenue model was intrinsically loss-making, because the focus was solely on growth and new customers. The curator then focuses on the ACM, which has not properly performed its task as supervisor. For example, Van Andel is surprised that the energy company received a permit at all, because the company would never have had the necessary qualities. From the report: \\\"A former employee of Flexenergie rightly called the ACM audit a desk exercise: a new energy company must complete the forms correctly and then receive a permit.\\\" According to Van Andel, it is too easy to set up an energy company, while the energy market is too complex to simply allow companies to join. In a response, the ACM points to politics: \\\"When the energy market was liberalized in 1998, politicians consciously chose not to make requirements for entrants too strict.\\\" The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate has announced that the outgoing cabinet is working on stricter requirements for energy suppliers and on stricter supervision by the ACM. The new Energy Act will go to the House of Representatives next year. But according to the curator, not only was the granting of permits too easy, but the supervision was also not properly carried out. In 2016, ACM already received complaints about irregularities, and according to the curator, they did not respond properly. The ACM could have intervened between the spring of 2017 and the autumn of 2018, but that did not happen. According to the curator, the additional debts of 15 million euros incurred during that period could have been avoided. The ACM says that it has reprimanded EnergieFlex with penalty payments and additional regulations, but according to the law it is only allowed to withdraw a permit if the requirements cannot be met or bankruptcy is threatened. According to the supervisor, this was not the case at the time. The Consumers' Association is also being tackled by the curator, because a large number of customers ended up at EnergieFlex through an 'energy auction' of the association. The association gathers as many customers as possible every year, after which energy suppliers can make a favorable offer for the entire group. The one with the best offer 'wins' that entire customer base. Energieflex won in 2015, 2016 and 2017 and acquired 24,000 customers in this way. The turnover for the association amounted to 1 million euros. The curator recommends repaying this amount, but the association does not like this: \\\"Repaying money to the estate means that the money goes to the Tax Authorities,\\\" says a spokesperson. \\\"Victims gain nothing from this at all.\\\" In 2018, the Consumers' Association excluded EnergieFlex from the auction when it turned out that something was wrong. Too late, Van Andel thinks. According to him, there were already enough signals that things were not right. He therefore asks whether the number of victims could have been much smaller if the Consumers' Association had acted appropriately. The Consumers' Association says about the criticism that the information about the abuses was not public and that supervision is not its task. However, since the bankruptcy of EnergieFlex, the Consumers' Association has started selecting companies in a different way. The financial position is now being checked. Inflation rose to 5.6 percent in November, the highest level since the first measurement by the European statistical agency Eurostat 24 years ago. The price increases have been going on for months and are accelerating, but not everyone is feeling them equally. \\\"I understand that there is fear: you have to pay more money for things of the same value,\\\" says Sandra Phlippen, chief economist at ABN Amro. \\\"But it is unwise for people to respond by buying now, because otherwise it will become more expensive. So try to keep your hoarding thoughts in check.\\\" The fact that inflation has risen to a record high is mainly due to higher energy prices. These have increased by more than a quarter across Europe. And according to Marieke Blom, chief economist at ING, that is also a reason not to worry too much. \\\"Realize that energy was very cheap a year ago. So that price comparison is not entirely fair. And it differs from person to person how inflation is felt. For example, the more you drive a car, the more you feel inflation.\\\" Phlippen agrees with this. \\\"The price increases are due to more expensive energy and raw materials. But that does not mean that everything you buy in the supermarket is also 5 percent more expensive. And that is not going to happen.\\\" There are several reasons why inflation is currently rising so rapidly. You can see exactly how this works in the video: Households with a low income or people who use a lot of energy are particularly affected by price increases. It was previously decided that households would receive hundreds of euros in compensation to cover the higher energy bill. The budget debate of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment is currently discussing whether the lowest incomes can be further accommodated. According to Phlippen, it is not necessary, for example, to set aside the end-of-year bonus - if you have one - because of the inflation figures. \\\"We should not panic. There is generally a lot of savings with which to absorb inflation.\\\" Higher energy prices are felt throughout Europe, making products and services more expensive. With 5.6 percent, the Netherlands is above the European average in November, but is not the leader. That is Lithuania, with an inflation rate of 9.3 percent. Neighboring countries Germany (6 percent) and Belgium (7.1 percent) also experience a higher inflation rate. Whether groceries are more expensive in Germany cannot be said based on the inflation figures. \\\"Inflation is about the change in price levels. So groceries can be cheaper in Germany, but rise in price faster,\\\" says Blom. According to the economists, it is difficult to say how inflation will develop. It may be a temporary effect due to energy prices, which corona also has a major influence on. Because as soon as people travel less due to corona measures, oil prices will drop again. And that in turn ensures lower inflation. In any case, economists do not yet see an immediate response to inflation. For example, there are no higher wages or more wage negotiations yet. The Central Bureau of Statistics will release the official Dutch inflation figure next Tuesday, according to a slightly different definition. That is expected to be around 5 percent. Residents of the municipality of Utrecht can receive a subsidy if they have their fireplace or stove removed. The city wants to reduce air pollution. Anyone who has their flue or fireplace removed or an old fireplace or stove replaced with a modern, less polluting stove can receive a subsidy of up to 2,000 euros. Utrecht residents can use the scheme until December 31, 2022. In an announcement, the municipality writes that wood burning by private individuals is one of the most important sources of air pollution that the city itself can influence. \\\"Major polluters such as traffic and industry have become increasingly cleaner in recent years, while the contribution of wood burning to air pollution has hardly decreased,\\\" says councilor Eerenberg. \\\"We want that to be different in Utrecht. We prefer that the fire stays out more often, but if wood is burned, then in the least polluting way possible.\\\" Earlier this year, the RIVM released new research showing that wood stoves and fireplaces are more polluting than previously assumed. A new calculation method shows that wood burning is the cause of 23 percent of particulate matter emissions in the Netherlands. Previously, 10 percent was assumed. Utrecht makes up to 4,000 euros available for Utrecht residents with a low income. The city has also launched a campaign educating about the harmful effects of wood smoke. The municipality provides, among other things, \\\"heating tips\\\", such as not burning in calm or foggy weather. Supermarket written backwards makes TKRAMREPUS. That is also the name of a 'reverse' supermarket in Amsterdam. This pop-up store on the Prinsengracht is open today and tomorrow. Visitors are expected to bring goods and not pick them up. All products and donations go to the approximately 4,000 people in Amsterdam who depend on the local food bank. Food bank board member Freek Wessels saw a 30 percent increase in the number of households knocking on doors for groceries this year. He attributes this to the corona pandemic. Food banks themselves are not having an easy time. Wessels: \\\"Supermarkets that help us have fewer products that are close to their sell-by date.\\\" The upside-down supermarket is an idea from a local job platform for young people. A spokesperson: \\\"We receive 700 tubes of toothpaste and 1,500 chocolate letters from suppliers. We especially need pasta sauce, sandwich spreads, soup and canned meat and pasta.\\\" Until this morning, the proceeds were forty full crates of groceries. The outgoing cabinet will not take additional measures to repair the deteriorated purchasing power as a result of high inflation. Outgoing State Secretary Wiersma of Social Affairs said: \\\"It is too early to predict how inflation and purchasing power will develop.\\\" He said he was still in discussions with municipalities, among others, about the possibilities of supporting the very lowest incomes where necessary, for example through social assistance. This had also been promised previously, following a motion to allocate 200 million euros for this. There will be more clarity about this before December 15. But that plan is not there yet: \\\"The implementation is complicated, also for municipalities,\\\" says Wiersma. MPs from PVV, GroenLinks, SP, PvdA, Denk, Bij1, Den Haan and Omtzigt, among others, had urged quick measures to help people affected by significant price increases. Senna Maatoug of Groenlinks: \\\"It is historic what we see here. The question is what do we say to the people who are already unable to make ends meet.\\\" On Tuesday it was announced that the provisional inflation rate for November was 5.6 percent. If the final figure next week is also above 5 percent, it will be the highest inflation since the 1980s. This high inflation is mainly due to high energy prices, but other items such as groceries are also becoming more expensive, partly driven by energy prices. It is very uncertain what will happen to inflation in the near future and the impact varies greatly per household. Households that use a lot of energy with a low income are particularly affected. Wiersma points out that 3.2 billion has already been earmarked for a reduction in energy taxes. Additional money is also available for healthcare and education salaries. New purchasing power maps will be released in March. Wiersma said: \\\"I think we have to look carefully at how everything develops. I also don't know what will come out of a new cabinet and what that will bring.\\\" When asked whether the minimum wage could not be adjusted, he said: \\\"It is a political choice that may take longer to implement and is on the formation table.\\\" Many Dutch people have been vaccinated against corona, but part of the population does not want a shot or is still unsure. Sometimes for religious reasons or other doubts, but sometimes also because of misinformation about the vaccines. This is also noticed by GP in training Bernard Leenstra. In collaboration with the GGD, he and other doctors take to the streets to talk to passers-by who have doubts about vaccination. \\\"Most people I speak to have not been vaccinated because they have doubts due to incorrect information on social media.\\\" The Ministry of Health has noted that more and more false information is being shared about the coronavirus and vaccinations. \\\"Disinformation was already a problem, but has become much more visible due to the corona pandemic.\\\" For example, there are stories about a higher risk of stillbirth during pregnancy. \\\"Almost nothing hits young women harder than something happening to your child,\\\" says GP Leenstra. \\\"It's not true at all, but you have to score eleven goals to put that right.\\\" Another GP, who wants to remain anonymous because of threats, also recognizes this. \\\"As a GP you can help people in this, as a kind of confidant. In that respect, it is worrying that the GP is under pressure, with more and more locums instead of permanent GPs and ten-minute consultations.\\\" A lot of disinformation is spread via Facebook. That company should do much more against this type of disinformation, says researcher Ritumbra Manuvie of the University of Groningen. \\\"What they are doing is really too little, too late. If you make money in a country, you also have to spend money to prevent abuse.\\\" For example, Manuvie came across 175 Facebook groups in which disinformation was spread. The platform took no action against the vast majority. \\\"While the conditions state that incorrect information about corona and the vaccines will not be accepted.\\\" At the same time, freedom of expression is also an issue: after all, you can say things that are not true. If an approach is too strict, people can also become anxious about sharing information, for fear that the information will be labeled as 'fake', notes Michael Klos of Leiden University, who researched freedom of expression on the internet. \\u201cAnd it involves enormous volumes that need to be assessed and viewed in context. Not everything that is wrong is against the rules.\\u201d The following posts are examples of disinformation, according to researcher Manuvie or GP Leenstra: Facebook reports in a response that it actively enforces disinformation. \\u201cWe have removed disinformation more than 24 million times, and blocked 3,000 accounts, pages and groups,\\u201d the company said. \\u201cWe showed information from fact-checkers on 195 million posts.\\u201d That is probably much more often than happens on the chat service Telegram. Statistics are not available, but incorrect information is often not removed, researchers note. While disinformation is regularly shared on a large scale: unlike on WhatsApp, Telegram groups can be enormous, with many tens of thousands of members, and such chat groups can be found via the search function. \\u201cI even saw a post explaining how to make a Molotov cocktail, in the context of the riots a few weeks ago,\\u201d says Manuvie. \\u201cEven that wasn't removed.\\u201d Telegram could not be reached for comment. Disinformation is also circulating on YouTube. Owner Google removed 4.4 million channels in the third quarter of this year due to deception, scams or spam. However, in many cases, disinformation has already reached people when it is removed. \\u201cDisinformation is sent in a minute, but debunking takes a lot of time and effort,\\u201d says Leenstra. Listening carefully and asking questions is the best method, according to Leenstra. \\\"Then someone says: I was very shocked by a message on Facebook. If you ask further questions, it turns out that someone simply has a fear of needles.\\\" Explaining why something is wrong can also work well, says Leenstra. \\\"We are seeing more and more pregnant women in the ICU. You also see that corona affects the uterus, so it is important to get vaccinated if you want you and your child to stay healthy.\\\" What certainly does not help is to portray people with vaccine doubts as \\\"wappies\\\", says the anonymous GP. \\u201cPart of the population has turned away from the rest, and we need to bring those two groups back together,\\u201d he says. \\\"That is not possible by dismissing people who often have genuine doubts as crazy. They must be given the right information.\\\" The government could also do more, he thinks. \\\"There is a sign language interpreter at the press conferences. But why are there no subtitles, also in other languages? \\\"Because the vaccination rate is also lower among minorities. Those people are not being reached.\\\" How (certainly) do we know what the vaccine side effects are? Nieuwsuur delved into the figures: Energy, fuel, food and clothing: it all became more expensive in November. Inflation was 5.2 percent in November, the highest reading in almost 40 years. These are price increases that will be felt in the pockets of many, but can hit people with a low income the hardest. Working people also ask for financial help more often, notes Walid Somers, debt counselor at Grip. The organization receives more registrations from people with a shortage of money. \\\"This is due to insufficient income in combination with the increased prices of the past period,\\\" says Somers. \\u201cIncreasingly, these are the working poor, a fairly new phenomenon but a fast-growing reality.\\u201d Where Somers used to get people to come with loans to buy new things, it is now the necessary debts that are increasing. \\\"These are debts that are included in the fixed costs. So people who have too little money to pay the increased energy bill, or cannot buy fuel for their car.\\\" Somers advises his clients to go back to basics and see what they can do themselves. \\\"Budget cooking, for example, see what you can do with leftovers. But keeping the heating on is also extremely expensive: 22 degrees in the house is really out of date with these prices.\\\" That 5 percent inflation is also high for Khadija. She and her husband both have jobs but struggle to make ends meet. She was shocked when she received December's energy bill. \\\"Some people really can't afford it. I actually can't either, because the rent is also rising, just like health insurance.\\\" These are bills that are still coming. The products are also now more expensive, Khadija notes. \\\"I always have to go to different stores to look for the best prices.\\\" We went to the supermarket with Khadija and compared product prices: \\\"Inflation mainly occurs in energy,\\\" says Peter Hein van Mulligen of CBS. \\\"And everyone has an energy bill. People with a well-insulated house and solar panels, for example, are less affected by this, but they often have a higher income. Otherwise, a higher energy bill simply means that you will be short of tens of euros at the end of the month.\\\" With higher inflation, the chance of long-term debt increases, says Van Mulligen. But there is also something to counter this at the moment: a tight labor market with low unemployment. \\u201cThe job prospects are quite good at the moment, unlike during the financial crisis, for example.\\u201d In 2020, the percentage of households with an income below the low-income limit fell further, reports the Central Bureau of Statistics. Last year this concerned 6.8 percent of households, in 2019 this was still 7.5 percent of all households in the Netherlands. The percentage has been declining since 2014. \\\"The risk of poverty also fell further in 2020, the first year of the pandemic, which was accompanied by a significant economic downturn but was supported by an extensive package of support measures,\\\" CBS writes. Poverty fell among households in general as well as among workers and minor children. There were also fewer households that were below the poverty line for a long period of time (at least four years in a row). In total, there were 513,000 households with an income below the low-income limit. Because there is a lot of discussion about what exactly poverty is, Statistics Netherlands does not want to say that these people all live in poverty, but that there is a risk of poverty among these households. That is why CBS also talks about the low-income limit, colloquially referred to as the poverty line. The limit is adjusted annually to price developments; in 2020 this was 1100 euros per month for a single person, 1550 for a couple, 2110 for a couple with two children and 1680 euros for a single-parent family. According to Statistics Netherlands, single-parent families, single people up to state pension age, households with a non-Western migration background, social assistance recipients and poorly educated people in particular face a relatively high risk of poverty. The question is whether poverty rates will also decrease this year. For example, it was announced yesterday that inflation in November was historically high at 5.2 percent. Energy, fuel, food and clothing all became more expensive. Khadija falls into that group of households with a low-income limit and pays close attention to prices. She sees that life has become a lot more expensive recently: Early next year, Amsterdam residents with a low income can get a laptop for a 20 euro 'deposit'. Organizations and private individuals can donate laptops for this purpose. This is possible from tomorrow, at the Cyberbank, an organization with which the municipality collaborates. The computers are refurbished by young people who are at a distance from the labor market, NH Nieuws reports. Councilor Meliani hopes that many laptops will be donated. \\\"Our city is digitizing at a rapid pace, a development that has been accelerated by corona. This also increases the gap between Amsterdammers who can use the internet and all digital options, and Amsterdammers who cannot.\\\" The municipality also has another initiative where people can receive a laptop. \\\"But that was set up because of the corona situation. A kind of emergency solution because we saw that many people did not come,\\\" says a spokesperson for the municipality. Nearly 4,000 Amsterdam residents have now received a laptop from that project. In principle, that initiative will expire this year. \\\"Cyberbank's initiative aims to create a permanent place where laptops are given to people every month.\\\" The Cyberbank also helps people with questions about computers. The computers are issued at a \\\"kind of food bank for laptops\\\" in East Amsterdam. Amsterdam residents can pick them up early next year. Anyone who wants a laptop must have a city pass. Users who no longer need the computers can return them. They will then get their 20 euros back. Households with an income at or just above the social minimum will receive at least 200 euros extra through the municipality to pay their energy bill. This amount is in addition to the compensation that the government has promised to everyone due to rising energy prices. The government previously released 3.2 billion euros to reduce energy taxes. Households with average consumption therefore pay more than 400 euros less in a year, the government says. But this does not help the lowest incomes sufficiently and that is why a one-off 200 million extra has been added for that group. \\\"We see that people are really getting into trouble,\\\" says State Secretary Wiersma of Social Affairs. \\\"That is why I have been working with municipalities to find a solution to further accommodate people with a lower income. We want to achieve this with this additional 200 million euros. The amount will be paid out by the municipality. The intention is that this will be done in the first will happen in the quarter of 2022. People on social assistance will automatically receive it on their account. Other groups, such as self-employed people with a low income and IOW and AOW recipients (without supplementary pension), can report to their municipality. Wiersma hopes to reach a maximum of 800,000 households He realizes that energy bills within that group can vary considerably. \\\"That depends on where you live and what contract you have. The money will undoubtedly also end up with people who do not have such a high energy bill, but also with people who spend a lot of money.\\\" The Woonbond, Milieudefensie and the FNV trade union previously asked for extra compensation for low incomes. organizations are happy that this is now happening, but had hoped for more. \\\"Unfortunately, it is much less than we advocate, while people can no longer pay their bills at the moment,\\\" says Bas van Weegberg of the FNV. \\\"It is a nice gesture, but it is nothing more than that,\\\" says Amma Asante of the National Client Council. \\\"I don't want to be sour, because every little bit helps. But it's too little. Everything is becoming more and more expensive and this money is incidental.\\\" The Woonbond, Milieudefensie and FNV would have preferred to see an adjustment to the rental allowance. \\\"For this you have to switch one button at the Tax Authorities and you will address all people with low incomes,\\\" says Weegberg. \\\" Now 350 municipalities have to set up a new scheme for the other low-income groups. That is bureaucratic and difficult to implement.\\\" They would also like to set up a Heat Fund, which would insulate the houses with the worst energy labels. \\\"Otherwise you will have to compensate people again next year,\\\" Weegberg thinks. \\\"In the long term, the government will save money with it.\\\" About two hours after the official white smoke text message, the door of the Logement, an annex building of the House of Representatives on the Plein, opens. The negotiators first had dinner together. Sukade, salmon, Brussels sprouts, chicory and strawberries with cream were on the menu, a source said. Then the party leaders of VVD, D66, CDA and ChristenUnie come out one by one. Somewhat tired, but satisfied, they speak separately to the press in front of the stairs of the 18th century building. \\\"A nice and balanced agreement,\\\" says D66 leader Kaag and Segers of the Christian Union (CU) is \\\"relieved that it is over.\\\" Rutte only says that it is a \\\"good agreement\\\". Only Hoekstra of the CDA knows how to describe the formation process in a concise manner. \\\"I'm glad we're out. It took a long time. It was like a pincer release.\\\" Watch what party leaders say about the agreement here: The four parties have broken records. It is 271 days after the House of Representatives elections, making it the longest formation ever. It has never happened before in parliamentary history that parties have publicly accused each other of such harsh and personal accusations and yet now want to continue together in one cabinet. The breach of trust between the parties has been reasonably repaired in the ten weeks of negotiations. While talking about tackling the major issues, such as climate, housing shortage and nitrogen, the noses of Rutte, Hoekstra, Kaag and Segers appeared to be on the same page, except for a few fundamental issues of course, such as migration, medical-ethical issues and the mortgage interest deduction. But bridges appear to have been built there too, as the negotiators' words now show. \\\"I'm satisfied with it,\\\" says Hoekstra. There has been intense discussion about medical-ethical issues, Segers acknowledges about his difference of opinion with D66 in particular in this area. \\\"It's nice to know where the other person's heart beats.\\\" He just doesn't want to say anything about the noted agreements. \\u201cIt is now up to the faction,\\u201d the four parties say in unison. \\\"It will be a recovery cabinet. With a lot of money they want to tackle problems that have remained unresolved for a long time - including under previous Rutte cabinets -; climate, nitrogen, the housing crisis, but also combating poverty and tackling inequality must become important themes in this cabinet With all these plans, they will also have to work on restoring trust.\\\" On Tuesday, the MPs of the intended coalition parties will consider the text, they can make changes and then it will really be finished. Informants Johan Remkes of the VVD and Wouter Koolmees of D66 actually wanted to make a thin coalition agreement as an experiment, but Koolmees said after the outcome \\\"that slightly more agreements have been made.\\\" Segers: \\\"It is thinner than the previous agreement\\\" of the four parties. The current coalition agreement 'Confidence in the Future' is 70 pages thick. This still secret document will be about 50 pages, a source from The Hague estimates. \\\"This cabinet does not, as usual, start with the benefit of the doubt. After the Benefits Affair and the lost confidence - also with the corona approach - Rutte IV has to come back from a very long way. That is only possible if they succeed in planning realize solutions to the major problems. What is politically vulnerable is that they do not have a majority in the Senate and, to put it mildly, there is not exactly a favorable opposition ready.\\\" The presentation is on Wednesday afternoon, almost nine months after the House of Representatives elections. Then the title, motto and number of pages also become truly public. There will be a debate on Thursday or Friday and then the fifteen opposition factions will give their opinion. Good morning! Today the factions are discussing the negotiating agreement that the leaders of VVD, D66, CDA and Christian Union agreed on yesterday. And the outgoing cabinet is holding a press conference about extending the corona measures. First the weather. The mercury rises to about 10 degrees and it is mainly cloudy. Only in the northwest does the sun manage to break through later. In the south and southeast it will remain drizzly for some time with some rain or drizzle. The southwest wind is blowing moderately, with a force of 3 to 4. Are you going on the road? Here you will find an overview of the work. Check the railway timetable here. Rutte IV Cabinet had the longest formation ever. It has never happened before in parliamentary history that parties have publicly accused each other of such harsh and personal accusations and yet now want to continue together in one cabinet. \\\"It will be a recovery cabinet,\\\" says reporter Ron Fresen. \\\"They want to use a lot of money to tackle problems that have remained unresolved for a long time - including under previous Rutte cabinets -; climate, nitrogen, the housing crisis, but also combating poverty and tackling inequality must become important themes in this cabinet. With all these plans, they also have to work on restoring trust.\\\" \\\"This cabinet does not start with the benefit of the doubt, as usual,\\\" says Fresen. \\\"After the benefits affair and the lost confidence - also with the corona approach - Rutte IV has to come back from a very long way.\\\" \\\"That is only possible if they succeed in realizing plans that provide solutions to the major problems. What is politically vulnerable is that they do not have a majority in the Senate and, to put it mildly, there is not exactly a favorable opposition ready.\\\" After the longest formation ever, the four parties of the current outgoing government have decided how they will continue in a new cabinet. That didn't happen without a fight; the road was long and difficult. From 'function elsewhere' to white smoke, view the retrospective of the formation: Happy Tuesday! Whether these are actions for healthcare, for the food bank or the Serious Request Glass House that started today: plenty of money is being raised for charities in the month of December. \\\"Especially now, people want to do something extra as a token of compassion for everyone who is less fortunate,\\\" says Margreet Plug, director of Goede Doelen Nederland. About two hundred charities are affiliated with these trade organizations. \\\"We see that many charities are organizing extra actions in December.\\\" The cold winter months and certainly the Christmas period evoke a strong sense of community, says Plug. \\\"Christmas is something you celebrate with your loved ones and family. Many people then reflect on the fact that this is not for everyone.\\\" This year, radio station NPO 3FM is returning to a successful formula. For the first time since 2017, the radio station is hosting DJs in the Glass House to raise money by letting people request records. This year the house is in Amersfoort and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) is linked to the campaign. The Serious Request campaign started this afternoon: The WWF is one of the largest members of Goede Doelen Nederland. In 2020, more than 75 million euros came in to this charity. KWF Kankerbestrijding is also a well-known name, with income around 150 million euros. CBF, the independent supervisor of charities, keeps track of exactly how much income the affiliated charities have in a passport for all members. According to professor of philanthropy Ren\\u00e9 Bekkers of the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam, research shows that 80 percent of Dutch people give to charities. \\\"Dutch treat (which means being stingy) is not an option, we are not frugal, on the contrary. We just know very well who we are giving it to. We pay close attention.\\\" Research by Bekkers that will be published next year shows that almost all Dutch people donate sometimes. \\\"Our research also looks at how giving behavior differs per household; if you compare this, you see that some households do not give one year and do so the next. The percentage of people who never give is then 2. per cent.\\\" The way we give to charities has changed. The excuse: 'I don't have any change with me' no longer applies. Many charities collect digitally, with the pin or a QR code. \\\"It is now easier to give 5 euros via debit card than at the door. Because then people give coins instead of bills.\\\" The trade organization also says that the coronavirus also has little impact on how generous people are. \\\"The impact of the corona crisis on society is great, including for charities. But despite disappointing collection proceeds, events and campaigns that came to a complete standstill, we saw great resilience among charities.\\\" The organization emphasizes that smaller organizations have a slightly harder time than larger ones such as KWF or WNF. \\u201cMedium and small organizations saw an average decline in revenue of 6 percent and 9 percent respectively in 2020, the year for which we have the most recent figures.\\u201d This is also what supervisor CBF says. They note that not only the smallest charities (up to 50,000 euros) are experiencing a decline in donations from private individuals, but that the group up to one million euros has been relatively hard hit. \\\"And while the largest charities (more than 30 million) have actually received 10 percent more income from private individuals.\\\" According to the trade association, smaller players are more vulnerable because they have more limited sources of income. \\\"Larger goals simply have more opportunities to draw attention to alternatives.\\\" The Lareb side effects center has received more than 17,000 reports of menstrual disorders after corona vaccinations until December 1 of this year. This concerns a variety of complaints, such as heavy or late menstruation. Reporters generally indicate that menstruation is different after vaccination than before. Most reports concerned heavy menstruation (about 4,500 times), followed by late menstruation (3,200 times), irregular menstruation (3,000 times) and interim bleeding (3,000 times). According to Lareb, it is still too early to say whether a disrupted cycle is really a side effect of the corona vaccines, more research is needed for that. But the side effects center does not rule out a connection. According to the side effects center, the vaccine activates the immune system and can therefore potentially influence hormone levels and the development and breakdown of the uterine lining. It is expected to be a temporary effect. Lareb also points out that menstrual disorders often occur even without vaccination. This can be caused by, for example, an infection, illness or stress. It is already clear that a corona vaccination does not lead to infertility. \\\"I understand the concerns about this very well,\\\" says Lareb director Agnes Kant. \\\"But fortunately, studies have been conducted that show the corona vaccine does not lead to infertility or reduced fertility.\\\" Since last summer, Lareb has been conducting follow-up research among 2,000 reporters. Follow-up questions are asked about the nature of the complaints and at what point in the cycle they occurred. It is unclear when the results of that follow-up study will be released. The side effects center also received many reports of bleeding after menopause. This involved about 500 reports, mostly submitted by women between the ages of 54 and 64. But women over 75 and women who had not had bleeding for more than ten years also registered. Reports occurred approximately as often after a first as after a second injection. Compared to the number of injections administered, reports were most common after the Janssen vaccine. In the Netherlands, 6.4 million women have been vaccinated. \\\"There are quite a few reports, and they are also striking in the sense that women say that they suddenly suffer from a menstrual disorder. We therefore think it is possible that it is a side effect,\\\" says Lareb director Kant. In principle, anyone can report a side effect to Lareb; it is not checked whether someone has actually had a vaccination. The side effects center therefore does not rule out the possibility that there are false reports. Yet the number of reports is so large that the reporting has been transferred to the Medicines Evaluation Board. To determine whether there is actually a side effect, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) will also have to conduct further research. Dutch people with a non-Western migration background are at greater risk of encountering financial problems, the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) has established in a study. The supervisor wants more attention to be paid to this problem, starting with the integration course. The AFM has calculated that a quarter of the Dutch population has a migration background and the organization expects this percentage to grow to 36 percent by 2050. This is a diverse group, with people with a non-Western migration background in particular being more financially vulnerable on average. Their level of education is lower on average, they generally earn less and are less likely to have a permanent contract. A large proportion of the first generation of migrants came to the Netherlands at a later age and therefore do not receive a full state pension. About 40 percent of pensionable Dutch people with a non-Western migration background even live below the poverty line. Many people are not aware that there is a scheme (AIO) that supplements income up to the social minimum. Dutch people with a non-Western migration background find the Dutch financial system complex, because simple information about financial products is missing or difficult to find. There is also a language barrier. \\\"More attention to the financial vulnerability of Dutch people with a non-Western migration background in particular seems necessary,\\\" the AFM writes. \\\"During the integration process, for example, more emphasis can be placed on financial self-reliance.\\\" At the beginning of this week, the gas price reached new record highs, but has fallen sharply again in recent days. The record of 180 euros per megawatt hour was reached on Tuesday, today around 12 noon the price was 106 euros. That's a drop of about 40 percent in three days. That 106 euros is also still high from a historical perspective. Before the increases in recent months, the gas price was below 40 euros. The recent price drop follows reports that many large ships full of LNG are en route to Europe from America. LNG is liquefied natural gas. The price of gas in Europe rose sharply this year because there is more demand now that economies are recovering from the corona crisis. There is also fuss about the commissioning of the new Nordstream 2 gas pipeline between Russia and Germany, which runs via the Baltic Sea. Europe is largely dependent on Russian natural gas. In recent weeks, political tensions have increased further between Russia and the West due to the build-up of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine. The existing pipelines between Russia and Western Europe run via Ukraine. The high gas price also leads to higher energy bills for consumers. That is why the outgoing cabinet will reduce energy taxes next year by around 400 euros for an average household. Low-income households can receive additional compensation through their municipality. The British YouTube duo LadBaby is at number one on the British music charts for the fourth consecutive Christmas Eve. The couple produced this year's song, Sausage Rolls For Everyone, in collaboration with Ed Sheeran and Elton John. The theme of all previous Christmas issues was also the sausage roll and the proceeds go to a food bank organization. The duo has broken a record with the listing; The Beatles alone had four listings on Christmas Eve, but they were not consecutive. The band hit number 1 in 1963, 1964, 1965 and 1967. \\\"Thanks to everyone who helped us make history. Dreams really do come true,\\\" LadBaby wrote on Twitter. All hits by Roxanne and Mark Hoyle, as the artists behind LadBaby are actually called, are covers. This year they covered Merry Christmas by Ed Sheeran and Elton John, a Christmas song that was released earlier this month. The original is at number 2 on the charts. Sheeran revealed on NPO Radio 2 at the beginning of October that he was going to release a Christmas album for the first time. Numbers 3 and 4 contain Christmas classics: Last Christmas by Wham! and All I Want for Christmas Is You by Mariah Carey. The top 5 is closed by a protest song: Boris Johnson is Still a Fucking Cunt by The Kunts. Good morning! On Christmas Day, King Willem-Alexander traditionally gives his Christmas speech, Pope Francis gives the traditional blessing Urbi et Orbi and the Top 2000 has started. On Christmas Day it will remain freezing in the entire northern half of the country with sunny periods. Some rain falls in the south and also (wet) snow in a narrow strip from South Holland to Limburg. There it will be 0 to 2 degrees. Furthermore, the easterly wind makes it feel a lot colder to us. Are you going on the road? Here you will find an overview of the work. Check the railway timetable here. The Top 2000 has started on NPO Radio 2, the list of the best songs of all time according to the station's listeners. The Top 2000 is broadcast from Sound and Vision in Hilversum. The list of lists can be listened to until midnight on New Year's Eve. Just like last year, the program is without an audience. The Top 2000 was opened by musician and DJ Bart Arens with a show on the roof of Beeld en Geluid in Hilversum, with a mash-up of well-known songs from the list: The British YouTube duo LadBaby is on the list for the fourth consecutive Christmas Eve. number one on the British music charts. The couple produced this year's song, Sausage Rolls For Everyone, in collaboration with Ed Sheeran and Elton John. The theme of all previous Christmas issues was also the sausage roll and the proceeds go to a food bank organization. Merry Christmas! The idea started at a church in Ommen: let people who do not need the extra government money for energy donate it to people who can use it. Several churches in the Netherlands have now joined the initiative. \\\"It was a spontaneous thought,\\\" says Kest Jelsma, a pastor in Ommen. \\\"When the government announced that it would provide 400 euros in energy compensation through a tax reduction, there were immediate voices from people who said they did not need it. That is why I approached other churches here in the municipality to do something with this.\\\" There are now many more churches in the country engaged in these types of actions, such as in this church in Apeldoorn: In Ommen people can deposit that money in a fund. The first donations are now pouring in. \\\"This comes, for example, from people who spend the winter in a distant country and are therefore not bothered by high energy costs,\\\" says Jelsma. From January, the money will go to people with low incomes in the form of supermarket vouchers, to avoid problems with the tax authorities. Everyone will receive a discount on their energy tax next year. According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, a household with an average energy consumption therefore pays more than 400 euros less, but this can vary greatly from house to house. The ministry has allocated 2.7 billion euros for this. The lowest incomes will receive an additional compensation of at least 200 euros. This is paid out through the municipalities: people with social assistance benefits receive them automatically, the rest of the people with a low income have to report to the municipality themselves. The compensations are not expected to cover the total costs for many households. Supermarkets in Apeldoorn also decided to participate in the campaign. \\\"We are in a working-class neighborhood in Apeldoorn and there is quite a bit of poverty here,\\\" says Wouter van de Bunt, owner of a Jumbo. \\\"So there are a lot of people who could use some extra. With the Christmas spirit in mind, this is a great initiative.\\\" How the campaign will be further rolled out in Apeldoorn has yet to be decided. \\\"We are thinking about giving people some extra stuff when they come to buy stuff from us,\\\" says Van de Bunt. \\\"Or we can increase the voucher a little.\\\" It is almost January 1, 2022. And that means that all kinds of new laws, rules and (tax) rates will come into effect. For example, from now on you can receive a tax-free home work allowance, smoking areas and cigarette vending machines will be banned and a new integration system will be introduced. We list the most important and remarkable changes for you, per topic that is changing a lot: taxes, housing, sustainability, companies and more. Due to high energy prices, the outgoing cabinet will reduce energy taxes once in 2022. As a result, an average household will pay 400 euros less tax next year. There is an additional scheme for approximately 800,000 low-income households; they can receive around 200 euros in compensation from their municipality. People on social assistance receive it automatically. Others who are eligible, such as self-employed people with a low income and state pensioners without a supplementary pension, must report to the municipality. Employers may now give a tax-free work-from-home allowance to employees of a maximum of 2 euros per day. That amount is based on a Nibud calculation of approximately what you spend on heating, coffee, toilet paper, and so on. Until now, tax had to be paid on such a home-working allowance, while a travel allowance is tax-free. In response to the benefits affair, a new law will come into effect that will make it easier to provide people with compensation \\\"if they are disadvantaged by unjustified actions or omissions by the Tax Authorities and end up in a distressing situation\\\", according to the outgoing cabinet. The new Tax Authorities, Benefits and Customs Inspectorate will start. This supervisory authority, established as a result of the benefits affair, must identify problems, investigate them and put them on the agenda. The inspectorate falls under the Ministry of Finance, but is independent and must act from the perspective of the citizen. There are minor adjustments that should slightly improve the purchasing power of different groups: The maximum income-related combination discount will be reduced. This is a tax credit for a single parent or the lowest earner of a couple with a child up to the age of eleven. The maximum discount is reduced by 318 euros and is disadvantageous for parents who earn 27,350 euros or more gross. This discount will decrease because as of August 2, 2022, both parents of a newborn child can receive nine weeks of paid parental leave. This measure costs money and those costs are partly offset by a reduction in the combination discount. The self-employed person's deduction has been gradually reduced for some time now to reduce the tax differences between self-employed people and employees. The deduction decreases by 360 euros to 6,310 euros. Self-employed people therefore receive less discount on their income tax. The new coalition agreement stipulates that this deduction will decrease more rapidly from 2023, with steps from 650 to ultimately 1,200 euros in 2030. Self-employed people will receive compensation during the next cabinet period through an increase in the earned income tax credit. Employees and job seekers can no longer deduct study costs when filing their income tax returns. This will be replaced by a new subsidy: The STAP budget. (STAP stands for Labor Market Position Stimulation). From March 1, you can request a maximum budget of 1,000 euros from the UWV. Entrepreneurs or people with income from other work can continue to deduct business study costs from their profits. Mind sports are not sports after all, because of the 'negligible physical component', the European Court of Justice has ruled. That is why, for example, bridge and chess clubs can no longer use the VAT exemption for sports clubs. They have to pay VAT on contributions, sales of drinks and registration fees, among other things. If they have less than 20,000 euros in income per year, they can opt for the small business scheme. Then they do not have to pay VAT, but they also cannot reclaim VAT on costs they incur. Many large municipalities will designate homes that may not be rented out after purchase. This should prevent buying up by investors. This is possible with the introduction of a new housing law. From now on, every municipality must also develop a housing vision, with a view to the problems in the housing market. Since 2021, a house must have a new, extensive energy label when sold. Last year the government did not enforce anything due to corona; That will happen from now on. To receive a label, an advisor must visit your home. On average this costs about 300 euros, the fine for sales without a label is 435 euros. The special tax that housing associations must pay will be reduced by a total of around 800 million euros to around 1 billion in 2022. This will leave associations with more money to build homes. The new coalition agreement has already decided that the landlord levy will disappear completely in 2023. Municipalities are now obliged to register homeless people with a postal address. If homeless people do not have acquaintances where this is possible, the municipality must make an address available, for example that of the town hall. An address should make facilities and care more accessible to a homeless person. From now on, couples are more entitled to mortgage interest deduction in a number of specific cases. For example, if someone buys a home with a partner and already had a house before that. Or if you have a house with a partner who dies. The maximum mortgage interest deduction has been decreasing step by step for a number of years. In 2022, this will increase from 43 to 40 percent. This only affects you if you have an income that falls in the second tax bracket (above 69,398), because then you will receive less of your mortgage interest paid back from the Tax Authorities. Every year the government determines how much you can borrow for a house based on your income. With an average expected wage increase of 2.2 percent, this amount will increase by around 5,000 euros for most. At the beginning of 2021, a higher transfer tax rate was introduced for buyers who are not going to live in a house themselves (8 percent). But this had an unintended effect in specific cases and is therefore being adjusted. If one of the buyers died or the buyers divorced between signing the purchase contract and the transfer at the notary, 8 percent transfer tax had to be paid, because not both buyers lived in the house. From now on, the buyer does not have to pay the higher rate with a 'declaration of transfer tax on unforeseen circumstances'. Corporations no longer have to pay 8 percent when they buy back Conditions of Sale houses from private individuals. These are homes that corporations sell to private individuals at a discount, to make a start on the owner-occupied market. If the owner wants to sell again, the association has the right to buy back the house. The additional tax for an electric company car will increase. This was 12 percent on the first 40,000 euros and 22 percent on the amount above that. This will be 16 percent on the first 35,000 euros of the car's list price and 22 percent on the amount above that. New lease drivers will therefore pay a little more for their electric car. At the same time, the annual subsidy pots for private individuals who buy a new or second-hand electric car will increase. For a new car the pot is 71 million and you can get 3350 euros. For a second-hand car there is 20.4 million and 2000 euros per car. These amounts also apply to private lease. New cars are increasingly environmentally friendly and economical. And the more economical, the less purchase tax (bpm) you have to pay for a car. But the government wants to maintain income from the BPM, so it will increase gradually until 2025, by about 2.3 percent per year. Electric cars will remain exempt from BPM until 2025 to stimulate sales. The environmental zone for trucks in 13 municipalities is becoming stricter. Trucks with emission class 4 and higher were still allowed to enter there, which became emission class 6. The higher the class, the less harmful emissions. Companies are extra encouraged to invest in environmentally friendly equipment. They can partially deduct the costs from their profit, which means they have to pay less profit tax. There were three percentages, depending on the type of investment: 13.5, 27 and 36 percent. That will be 27, 36 and 45 percent. More environmentally friendly devices are often a lot more expensive. In some cases, double energy tax must now be paid when generating (sustainable) energy. For example, when solar energy is supplied to a company that stores the electricity in batteries and then again when that electricity is supplied from those batteries to the end user. Due to a change in the law, from now on only the final supply of electricity will be taxed. This should encourage the storage of energy in batteries. The home address of entrepreneurs and directors of companies can no longer simply be requested from the trade register of the Chamber of Commerce. This should protect their privacy. Some parties are still allowed to see the data, such as the tax authorities and bailiffs. The business address of an entrepreneur can still be requested. At listed companies, one third of the Supervisory Board must consist of women. Of the 89 companies listed on the stock exchange, 61 already met the requirement a few months ago. The obligation works like this: if a place becomes available on the Supervisory Board of a company that does not yet meet the quota, no man may be appointed for that position. Tax avoidance by multinationals is being further tackled. For example, they can offset losses they make abroad to a lesser extent against the profits they make in the Netherlands. It also limits the possibility of deducting payments from tax in one country without these payments being taxed in the other country. Early-stage companies such as startups often give employees stock options in lieu of wages. As soon as an employee converts that option into a share, tax must be paid. But because such shares may not yet be sold, an employee may now also pay tax later, only when the shares become tradable. Because then you can sell shares and pay tax on part of the proceeds. Corporate tax or profit tax will be adjusted. Companies pay 15 percent tax on their first 395,000 euros of profit. That was about the first 245,000 euros. The rate for all profits above will increase slightly, from 25 to 25.8 percent. As a result, companies with between 245,000 and 2,270,000 euros in profit will pay less tax and companies with higher profits will pay more. Anyone who wants to start a new healthcare provider must from now on meet stricter requirements. This makes it possible to determine whether a provider has criminal intentions through a so-called BIBOB procedure. A Declaration of Good Conduct may also be requested from directors and supervisors of an organization. Existing healthcare organizations must also comply with this; they are given two years to do so. Smaller employers will pay less premium for the disability fund. People who are ill or incapacitated for work for a long period of time are paid from that fund. That premium was the same for all companies, 7.03 percent last year. It will be 5.49 percent for small companies and 7.05 percent for large ones. All buildings in the Netherlands where people work must be completely smoke-free. This has already applied since July 1, 2021 for (semi-)public buildings such as hospitals and town halls. From now on, companies where only employees come are no longer allowed to have a smoking area. So you can only smoke outside and at home. Catering establishments are no longer allowed to sell smoking products through cigarette vending machines. Sales at the bar were already prohibited. To make smoking more difficult, the number of points of sale is being reduced step by step. For example, tobacco will no longer be allowed to be sold online in 2023 and no longer in supermarkets in 2024. Gift vouchers must now be valid for at least two years. That was one year. In practice, many gift vouchers had already been valid for some time. The commonly used VVV gift card retains its entire value for three years. After that, 6 euros will be deducted from the value every year as a 'management fee'. Since January 1, 2021, tractors have had to have a license plate to be allowed on public roads. This year served as a transition year, it will be mandatory as of January 1, 2022. The rules also apply to construction vehicles such as excavators, articulated mops and skid steer loaders, as well as golf carts. The minimum wage will increase slightly, for someone aged 21 and older it will be 1,725 \\u200b\\u200beuros gross per month. Since July 2021, that was 1,701 euros. If a customer of a sex worker knows that forced prostitution is taking place, that customer will now be punishable and can receive up to four years in prison or a fine of up to 21,750 euros. The new Integration Act comes into effect. Municipalities will guide newcomers who are subject to integration requirements. Everyone receives a tailor-made integration. Among other things, it will be possible to complete the process faster. The language level that people have to learn goes up a step, it is now A2 (basic user) and becomes B1 (independent user). And based on a 1963 treaty between the EU and Turkey, newcomers from Turkey did not have to integrate for a long time. But that's changing now. It is now also mandatory for them. Based on rulings by the European Court of Justice, an obligation is now possible. From now on, all entrances to new-build homes may only have a threshold of a maximum of 2 centimeters. This rule already applied to at least one entrance, for example only the back door. This now applies to all accesses and also the route from the public road to the home. This should improve the accessibility of homes. A shopkeepers' association, owners' association or landlord can no longer force a shopkeeper to keep the shop open at certain times without the shopkeeper's consent. The rule is partly due to a conflict in a Groningen shopping center, where retailers had to open on Sundays under the threat of fines. If someone dies, their claim-free years of car insurance can now be transferred to their partner. Ex-partners can also divide the claim-free years after a divorce. You can also take the claim-free years of a lease car with you. Insurers have agreed this with the Consumers' Association. New, temporary rules apply to alleviate the high workload and staff shortages in childcare. This means that employees in training can be deployed more quickly. And when supervising and enforcing the rules, more account is taken of staff shortages, for example if an employee suddenly becomes ill and cannot be replaced immediately. This should prevent closures and fines for childcare locations.\",\n          \"Prime Minister Balkenende thinks it is a good idea if everyone keeps their sidewalk free of snow. During his weekly press conference, the Prime Minister responded to a journalist's proposal to make such an appeal to the Dutch people. There is no longer a legal obligation for citizens to keep their sidewalks clean during severe frost. Balkenende's appeal is more of a moral request to the population. Feeling \\\"I sense a common feeling that it is good if people know how to keep their sidewalks clean,\\\" said the Prime Minister. \\\"It is in the interest of others. It also has to do with a responsibility to society.\\\" Due to the severe frost, many sidewalks are slippery. Municipalities, which are struggling with a major salt shortage, have not cleaned many sidewalks, walking and cycle paths. Older people often no longer dare to go out. Hospital emergency rooms are busy treating bone fractures. In Belgium, keeping the sidewalk free of snow is still mandatory. For example, 175 fines have already been issued in Antwerp for people who had not done so. Such a fine can amount to 250 euros. Energy bill Balkenende does not feel like compensating low-income citizens for their energy bill, which may skyrocket due to the severe frost. Minimum-age people who get into trouble can ask their municipality for support. More and more small self-employed people are encountering problems due to the financial crisis and are turning to food banks for help. According to the Food Bank Netherlands, dozens of small entrepreneurs ask for free food every week. The incomes of many self-employed people have fallen so sharply in recent months that they have insufficient money for food and drinks. Randstad The problem mainly occurs in the Randstad. There are also more small companies there, for example in construction. According to the Food Bank Netherlands, there is still enough to distribute, but it is becoming more difficult to maintain supplies. This is partly because many suppliers give away less. The FNV continues to heavily criticize the government's plans to raise the state pension age to 67. In a hearing in the House of Representatives, Chairman Jongerius said that citizens are presented with the bill and that there is no fair sharing. She also believes that the demands placed on people to stop at 65 are too onerous. She called the distinction between heavy and non-heavy work unworkable. Heavy professions The employers' organizations support raising the state pension age to 67, but they also had major criticism of the scheme for heavy professions. The arrangement that the government wants means that people with a demanding profession will be offered another position after thirty years. \\\"That proposal must be off the table,\\\" said Bernard Wientjes, chairman of the employers' organization VNO-NCW. \\\"We have to come up with something else for that.\\\" How to do this is \\\"extremely difficult\\\". He is prepared to make good agreements about this with the trade union movement. In addition, there is no list of professions that can be regarded as difficult. Employers and employees fear an administrative mess. Income limit The FNV is considering an income limit. People on a low income who often have a demanding job and start working early should be able to retire at 65 while retaining a full state pension. Above that limit, the unions are considering a discount of up to 5 percent. In this proposal for an income limit, Wientjes sees 'elements' on the basis of which further discussions can be held. Because it will take another ten years before the state pension age will increase, employers are in no hurry to find a solution. The trade union movement, on the other hand, does not want to first agree to an increase in the state pension age and then wait and see what the additional policy will look like. For this reason, the trade unions FNV, CNV and MHP urgently appealed to the House of Representatives to discuss the bill and the additional policy together. It is not yet clear whether this will happen. Demonstration On Wednesday morning, several hundred people demonstrated against the cabinet's plans on the Plein in The Hague. Among the demonstrators were several dozen firefighters who caused some unrest by entering the House of Representatives building in full uniform. After some pressure from security, they left the building. FNV Bondgenoot and Abva Kabo FNV also took action in Rotterdam and The Hague public transport. By literary editor Jef van Gool \\\"Do you ever hear women talk about themselves with the same endearment that men can have for the little boy they once were?\\\" Connie Palmen raises this question in the letter to her young self, to that apparently unchangeable \\\"something\\\" with which she completely coincides, but which is at the same time foreign to her. In honor of the 75th anniversary of Book Week, the CPNB is not publishing a Book Week essay this year, but a bound book of 300 pages in which 75 prose writers, poets and children's book authors write a letter to their young selves. What knowledge, acquired over the years, would they like to pass on to him or her? The reason for this is the theme of the Book Week, 'Titantjes Growing Up in Literature'. Ronald Giphart writes that he carried his young self out of the house a few years ago in a wheelbarrow, after his literary archive had been reduced to papier-m\\u00e2ch\\u00e9 in a flooded cellar. By the age of seventeen he had become a writer \\\"and that's about the only exciting thing I can think of.\\\" Incongruous The intention to become a writer and the spark that fueled it is reflected in many of the letters. Usually it is a decision that goes diametrically against the expectations of the environment. Choosing individuality over safety, as Arthur Japin calls it. \\u201cTake it from me, you will be happiest throughout your life when you turn away from the norm and give in to the absurd.\\u201d In realizing, for the first time, that she was an independent being, Christine Otten also found the seeds of becoming a writer, the choice for an idealism that is entirely anchored in language. Carolijn Visser addresses 26-year-old Carolijn, who was chastised by \\\"the left-wing church\\\" for the way she wrote in an article in the NRC about the Sandinistas in Nicaragua and later about poverty and oppression in China. She then found support from Renate Rubinstein, who, with a liberating burst of laughter, told her not to be intimidated. Book list Many contributions are also about reading and about books that have been important. The Catcher in the Rye by J.D., who died last week. Salinger made Bart Moeyaert decide not to return to the provincial town where he had grown up. The work briefly aroused Nico ter Linden's ambition to become a translator. Marita Mathijsen, a frequent reader as a child and secondary school student who ignored Oeroeg and Het bitter kruid because they were too thin, would have liked to encourage her young self to keep a notebook of everything she had read. She also wanted to get her hands on some classic children's books. Bernlef lectures the debutant he was and points out the mistakes in Washing Stones. He recommends the writers he should read. Stinking We were also about other, sometimes very personal things, of course, in Titaantjes we were, as in the letter from Abdelkader Benali to \\\"Dear Appie\\\", who becomes Abdel in the first week at secondary school and sheds his childish nest smell like a girl with the commanding, dominant eyes of an adult tell him he stinks. \\u201cYou smell yourself and you decide you can't be yourself in front of others.\\u201d 52 male and 23 female authors have been collected, together representing almost the top of Dutch literature. Arnon Grunberg is one of the authors who did not respond to the CPNB's request. He informed the organization that not only did he not have the time, but that he would not know what else to write to his younger self than \\\"it would have been better if you had not been born\\\". 'We were titans' is on sale during Book Week (10 to 20 March) for 10 euros. In some cities, student actions will continue for the time being. In Utrecht, students are preparing for a long night in a university building that they have occupied all day. Negotiations with the Executive Board in Utrecht were broken off because the students felt that they were not being taken seriously. Students also still occupy a lecture hall at Erasmus University in Rotterdam. The occupations in Amsterdam and Nijmegen are over. Abolition of the grant About forty students have been occupying the building of the Executive Board of Utrecht University all day. No one is allowed in anymore. They are protesting against the possible abolition of the student grant by taking the building. Follow the actions closely via NOS Headlines The students are demanding that the university board distance itself from what the VSNU, the umbrella organization for universities, said last week. The VSNU and the HBO Council then announced that they were open to changes to the student financing system. Protests are also expected to take place in other places in the country today. The demonstrating students are afraid that student financing will be abolished and that a loan system will be introduced instead. They think that studying will no longer be accessible to everyone and demand that universities better represent student interests. The National Student Union (LSVb) supports the actions. Cuts The House of Representatives and the cabinet are currently discussing cuts in various committees, because they have to save a total of 35 billion euros next year. Education Minister Ronald Plasterk says that cuts can also be made to the student financing system. The LSVb expects that many students will then stop studying, especially if their parents have a low income. The student union is also concerned about the price-quality ratio of education. \\\"Students have to pay more and more, while the quality of education continues to decline,\\\" said LSVb chairman Gerard Oosterwijk. The student union wants to gain insight into the consequences of abolition and has therefore started its own survey among students and teachers. On wiljijstufi.nl everyone can give their opinion on whether or not to abolish the basic grant. Municipalities will have to make significant cuts in the coming years, but this plays no role at all in the campaign. \\\"Parties are beating around the bush,\\\" says Maarten Allers, from the University of Groningen. According to him, the government will make significant cuts to the municipal fund. In addition, municipalities must take into account higher social assistance benefits and lower tax revenues. It is striking that many parties say nothing about this in their programs. Appie van der Beek, campaign chairman of the Doesburg City Party: \\\"Tough times are coming. You can only promise the nice things, but the Doesburger won't fall for that. We think the hired army of civil servants can do a little less.\\\" Patricia Wevelkate, campaign coordinator PvdA Doesburg \\\"You can of course also consider increasing income. Doesburg has the lowest tax burden in the Achterhoek. But that is lame, let's mention three items for cuts: 1) the reintegration policy is completely unprofitable. 2) The municipal organization can be cheaper. 3) the preparation costs for the redevelopment of the 'Concrete Plant' amount to 620,000 euros. These can wait a while!\\\" Hans van Hooft, party leader SP Nijmegen \\\"With an SP councilor responsible for finances, we have made the city financially healthy in recent years. We have reserves that other municipalities are jealous of. We are now going to use them. We will continue to invest in important facilities for the neighborhoods and the city.\\\" Koos van Boven, leader of the GemeenteBelangen Ede faction \\\"Of course we have ideas about a number of cuts and some things will be said about them during the campaign, but for now we are keeping the powder dry for a while.\\\" Marije Eleveld, party leader PvdA Ede \\\"It is true that we have not given much substance to the cuts. We just have to see how much it will ultimately be. We prefer to now look at the themes on which we would rather not make cuts. If any questions arise, we will indicate that we will rather spend money on stones (for example renovation of the country roads) than on social themes (such as combating poverty).\\\" Arnold Versteeg, candidate councilor SGP Ede \\\"The subject of cutbacks is a hot item. Every right-thinking party would therefore do well to formulate a vision: what is primary and what is of secondary importance? By primary matters I mean, for example, care and safety. And among secondary matters, for example, sports and culture.\\\" Ine van Burgsteden, party leader CDA Arnhem \\\"The election program of the CDA Arnhem does not mention any concrete austerity measures. At the end of last year, in the debate about the cuts, which are estimated at 55 million euros for Arnhem, we specifically proposed revising the municipality's tasks. There must be an assessment of efficiency, in which no policy area should be excluded, which is impossible with the task before us. In the campaign we notice that awareness about the cuts is not yet present among citizens and the other parties .\\\" Gelderland A municipality under supervision because its finances are not in order in the short and long term. A provincial spokesperson notes that municipalities have plans that cannot be paid for in the long term. This will become even worse in the coming months: \\\"Promises are made during elections and the question is whether it is all affordable,\\\" says a spokesperson. Pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline broke the rules when promoting a vaccine against cervical cancer. This is stated in a report from the Healthcare Inspectorate that the newspaper Trouw obtained after an appeal to the Public Access Act. According to the Inspectorate, the pharmaceutical company has, among other things, prohibited advertising among nurses and given purchase discounts to companies that wanted to sell the vaccine. In addition, GSK paid doctors for advice without it being clear what that advice entailed. At the time, Minister Klink of Public Health appointed GSK as the sole supplier of the vaccine against cervical cancer. It is not known what kind of punishment GSK will receive. People with a low income are less active in their free time than people who earn more, according to figures from Statistics Netherlands. They exercise less often, participate less in clubs and visit museums less often. They spend a relatively large amount of time in front of the TV. People with a low income also see their friends less often. When contacting family members, there is no connection with the level of income. Volunteer work People who earn more often do volunteer work in an organized context. There is no difference between the different income groups in providing informal help. Dutch municipalities are hit hard by the recession. According to the Association of Dutch Municipalities (VNG), municipalities had a deficit of almost 1.8 billion euros in 2009. This year the financial burden is more than 1.3 billion euros. Large cities in particular have had to make significant concessions due to the economic crisis. The shortage is mainly due to less construction. As a result, land development yields much less, says the VNG. At the same time, expenses have increased. In particular, municipalities spend more money on social assistance benefits and have to invest more money in poverty policy. Cutbacks As soon as the housing market picks up, incomes will increase again, the VNG predicts. Nevertheless, according to the association, municipalities will remain with a deficit of half a billion euros, even if the economy improves in the coming years. In addition, contributions from the government will probably decrease due to cutbacks in The Hague. Drug manufacturer Sanofi Pasteur MSD has repeatedly broken the law in promoting Gardasil, a vaccine against cervical cancer. This is stated by the Healthcare Inspectorate. It is prohibited to advertise a medicine that can only be obtained by prescription. At information meetings about cervical cancer, too much attention was paid to the drug itself. Furthermore, the marketing also targeted women over 26, although it has not been proven that it also works for them. In addition, the manufacturer pacified general practitioners with gifts that were not related to their profession, in the hope that they would prescribe the drug. According to Sanofi Pasteur MSD, the gifts were relatively small, such as teaspoons, chocolates and Christmas cakes. Dagblad Trouw demanded that the inspection report be made public. Sanofi Pasteur MSD tried in vain to stop this through the courts. Former minister Pieter Winsemius (VVD) will be presented as a scout tomorrow in Rotterdam. He must map out the options available to form a new municipal executive. Sources around City Hall report this. Winsemius starts with a broad exploration of the possibilities of collaboration. All parties in the Rotterdam council agree with Winsemius' role. The VVD is no stranger to the council. He was a member of a platform that advised on poverty reduction in Rotterdam. No revote In the council elections, the PvdA emerged as the largest, but the party has as many seats as Leefbaar Rotterdam. Yesterday it became clear that no new elections will be held in the Maasstad. This was insisted upon because there were several irregularities during the polls. However, these were not so serious that they could have significantly influenced the outcome. The House of Representatives wants clarification from Minister Klink about a RIVM study into cervical cancer. Girls aged 15 to 17 are asked to complete an online questionnaire about their sex life and send a smear test to the RIVM. CDA, PvdA and ChristenUnie are concerned about the privacy of the girls if DNA from the smear is kept for 15 years. CDA and ChristenUnie are also not happy with the 10 euro gift voucher that the participants receive. The RIVM says that it only looks at the virus that causes cervical cancer (HPV) and not at the DNA. The SP sharply criticizes many proposals from the working groups. According to party leader Roemer, people with a low income, the unemployed and the sick will be \\\"frightened\\\". According to Roemer, the House has been sidelined for months, and there is now a laundry list of proposals that you cannot get through. D66 leader Pechtold has found little new in the reports. He believes that the advantage of the publications is that the parties cannot run away from the choices so close to the elections. Parties that say that the housing market can remain this way now have it in black and white that this is not possible, says D66. The SP sharply criticizes many proposals from the working groups. According to group leader Emile Roemer, people with low incomes, the unemployed and the chronically ill will be \\\"terrified. On the other hand, few bankers or multinationals will be shocked,\\\" he said. Roemer further said that what the SP already feared had happened. \\\"The House has been sidelined for months, and now there is a laundry list of proposals that you can hardly get through,\\\" he said. \\u201cCutbacks have to be made, we cannot avoid that,\\u201d Roemer said. The SP wants less bureaucracy in healthcare, fewer civil servants and limits on mortgage interest deductions. D66 leader Pechtold has found little new in the reports. He believes that the advantage of the publications is that the parties cannot run away from the choices so close to the elections. \\u201cNow is the time to show how to turn around the national debt,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe numbers fit our program,\\u201d Pechtold said. D66 wants to eliminate the annual deficit of 29 billion in 2 cabinet terms. However, the party does not want to cut back on education, but rather invest in it. \\u201cYou can also win money that way,\\u201d he said. Pechtold also said that he thinks it is good that people gain more insight into healthcare costs. \\\"You will have to pay a little more for this yourself,\\\" he said. \\\"Parties that say that the housing market can remain this way now have it in black and white that this is not possible,\\\" Pechtold said. The CDA believes that the plans of the working groups make it clear that fundamental choices are necessary. \\\"Every political party must show its colours, the cheese slicer can stay in the kitchen drawer,\\\" said deputy group leader Spies. According to her, the mortgage interest deduction can remain unchanged if government bureaucracy is cut. \\\"And more efficiency in healthcare means that the deductible does not have to increase significantly,\\\" says Spies. The PvdA recognizes that it is not possible to make cuts without pain. \\\"But we must distribute the burden fairly and ask the most from those who have the most,\\\" said group leader Hamer. She sees no point in high personal contributions in healthcare. \\\"Then care becomes inaccessible to people with low incomes,\\\" Hamer said. She is charmed by ideas to limit the mortgage interest deduction for expensive houses. The VVD speaks of an \\\"Aha-Erlebnis\\\". According to MP Weekers, the working groups present proposals that the VVD has already made before. He believes that the government has made a mess of things and that the bill should not be passed on to future generations. According to the PVV, the working groups present a number of anti-social proposals. Party leader Wilders sees no point in intervening in mortgage interest deduction, the deductible in healthcare and the AOW. He wants to cut back on development cooperation, mass immigration and public broadcasting, among other things. GroenLinks leader Halsema says that many of the proposals lead to unacceptable social contradictions. \\\"The most vulnerable people will suffer from drastically increasing the deductible and the personal contribution for the GP,\\\" says Halsema. But she likes the plans to limit the mortgage interest deduction, for example. Prime Minister Balkenende does not respond to the proposals, but leaves that to the political parties, who can use the plans in the preparation of the elections. He said he only hoped that a new cabinet will be formed soon that can make choices. By editor Lambert Teuwissen She was the sweetheart of the biggest Dutch traitor during the Second World War. She acted to protect his identity, blindly following him to Berlin and covering up evidence of his murders. 65 years after the liberation, Corrie den Held finally wants to tell her story. After years of silence, she spoke to historian Auke Kok, who had written the book 'The Traitor' in 1995 about her husband, Anton van der Waals. As a double agent, he was responsible for the arrest of more than eighty resistance members, of whom at least forty were killed. He was executed for his actions in 1950. Fifteen years ago his widow did not want to talk to Kok. Now that most of those directly involved have died, she wanted to be open. The resulting book, 'War Love', will be published this week. Kok acted as confessor and therapist for Den Held. \\\"It was quite a process that we went through together,\\\" Kok explains. \\\"She never wrote it down for herself, it was just loose pieces for her. We tried to put them together into a whole.\\\" Den Held tells Kok how, as a blue-haired girl, she quickly fell for Van der Waals, whom she met as the worldly wise gentleman and resistance hero Henk van Lynden. They were married within a year, but around that time, summer 1944, Corrie also had its first doubts. \\\"D-Day has passed and the Germans are on the defensive. She can tell from Henk that he is anticipating the arrival of the Allies with the necessary care,\\\" Kok explains. \\\"But she has an incredible ability to conceal unpleasant impressions. Love is blind, they say, and that certainly applied to her.\\\" Van der Waals is now playing doubles for the Germans. He infiltrates resistance groups and hands people over to the Security Service. Corrie gets very little of that. \\\"She only noticed that he was really bad in the autumn of 1944, when he sawed the servant into pieces.\\\" Henk and Corrie are on the run from the ever-advancing Allies, together with his servant, Willem Mossinkoff. One day the man disappears. Corrie believes her husband when he assures her that he had to shoot him in an emergency. She is there when he dumps a large suitcase during a pleasure boat trip a few days later. Both then pose as Mr. and Mrs. Mossinkoff for a while. According to Kok, this is the moment when Den Held can no longer deny it to himself. Yet she stays with him. \\\"She was a young woman who was completely under the influence of her husband. She also knew that he had many connections, with the resistance, but also with the Germans. She was terrified that if she would indicate that she herself would become a victim.\\\" By the way, she continues to love her husband. \\\"The fascinating thing is that that fear can apparently coexist with love and conviviality. That has really fascinated me as a man. Apparently a woman can do that,\\\" Kok concludes. \\\"I notice from women who have read it that they are torn between irritation and empathy. Apparently it is a character trait of hers that she is able to maintain something indefinitely.\\\" How long becomes apparent in the final chapters of the book. Corrie follows Van der Waals when he starts working as a double agent for the Allies in Germany. With his SD contacts he could be a valuable pawn at the start of the Cold War. However, Van der Waals defects to the Russians and leaves Corrie in poverty in the devastated Berlin. It was not until 1947 that she returned to the Netherlands, tracked down to serve as a witness in the trial against Van der Waals. \\\"Her love for Henk remained behind in Germany,\\\" Kok concludes. She testifies against him at the trial where he would ultimately receive the death penalty. Although she was aware of at least two murders, she herself has not been prosecuted. She was said to have been too much under the influence of Van der Waals. The question arises whether Van der Waals ever really loved Corrie. Or was the woman twelve years younger just another element of a cover-up? Kok calls both possibilities plausible. \\\"In any case, she was the ideal partner for him: much younger and naive, accommodating, charming, sweet and sociable, but when it comes down to it, a go-getter and not so fearful.\\\" \\\"The fact is that if he seriously takes into account that he will be on the scaffold in 1944, he takes a number of measures for the benefit of his Corrie. That indicates a certain degree of selflessness.\\\" Does her story change Kok's image of Van der Waals? \\\"In my opinion, he has become more human than he was before. At that time I thought he was a psychopath, someone who only enters into relationships based on calculation. Now he was a sociopath, but not to the extent that I thought at the time. He was indeed loving towards Corrie and I am convinced that that was sincere.\\\" Auke Kok - War love: The wife of Anton van der Waals - De Bezige Bij - ISBN: 9789023458265 - \\u20ac17.90 The Stemwijzer, the online voting aid, has had a million visitors. This is reported by the Institute for Public and Politics, which set up the website. The sit went on air on May 7. 67% of visitors believe that the current mortgage interest deduction should remain. 86 percent of visitors believe that there should be much stricter punishments for people who use violence. SP leader Roemer is disappointed that PvdA leader Cohen does not clearly opt for the left, he said at a party meeting in Amsterdam. Roemer hopes that the PvdA will opt for a left-wing coalition for the elections. During the previous elections in 2006, SP leader Marijnissen challenged Bos to go for the left, but Bos rejected the invitation. According to Roemer - unfortunately - the same thing is happening again. There is a lot of voting on the internet about who the winner of the RTL debate is and the results vary considerably. The research agency Synovate: 1) Rutte with 34% 2) Cohen with 23% 3) Balkenende and Wilders with 18% (no internet poll) Telegraaf: 1) Wilders with 42%, 2) Rutte with 33%, 3) Cohen with 15% , 4) Balkenende with 10%, NRC: 1) Cohen with 44%, 2) Rutte with 30%, 3) Wilders with 17%, 4) with 7% No Style: 1) Rutte with more than 47.5%, 2 ) Wilders with 36% 3' Cohen with 10.7%, 4) Balkenende with 5.7%. The numbers are still changing, because voting is still possible. Alexander Pechtold is in the Park near the Euromast for a Twiknick, a picnic for Twitter users. He has invited all his Twitter followers. GroenLinks, PvdA, D66 and possibly the SP. That is Femke Halsema's 'dream coalition', the GroenLinks party leader said in an interview in the editorial office of the Zeeland newspaper PZC. According to RTL 4, the Prime Minister's debate was the most tweeted topic worldwide on Whit Monday. Between 8:30 PM and 10:30 PM, almost 7,000 people posted more than 30,000 tweets about the subject online. The debate therefore generated 177 tweets per minute. PVV MP Hero Brinkman has started a signature campaign to convince his group that it is time for a youth wing of the PVV. Several dozen young people attended the meeting. According to Brinkman, the initiative is in line with his pursuit of more transparency and democracy in the party. The programs of the PVV and VVD in particular are \\\"disastrous\\\" for an effective approach to global poverty and other global problems such as climate change. This is what development organizations said at the launch of the World Voting Map. This map provides an overview of the most important positions of political parties on international cooperation. Many Dutch people living outside the European Union can vote for the first time in a Dutch embassy on June 9. Until now, voters abroad could only go to embassies in countries where many Dutch people reside. A polling station is now being set up in all 93 embassies outside the EU. Dutch voters abroad must be registered as such. 11.24 am: Campaigning is also being conducted on Whit Monday. Marianne Thieme tweets that she is on her way to the open day of the Amsterdam Animal Shelter. SP party leader Emile Roemer responds to the ANP on the RTL debate: \\\"The Netherlands had to watch how three right-wing politicians shamelessly refuted each other about the causes of the economic crisis, while Cohen had his hands tied due to the participation of the PvdA in Balkenende IV.\\\" He adds: \\\"If after Sunday evening Cohen is not prepared to join me and others on the left in calling on the Netherlands to reverse the right-wing disaster, then I really no longer understand the PvdA.\\\" The day after the prime minister's debate on RTL 4. The KijkOnderzoek Foundation reports that more than 1.3 million people watched the debate between Balkenende, Cohen, Rutte and Wilders. The afterthought attracted 1.5 million viewers, making it the most watched program on Whit Monday. Press release. The Netherlands Astrological Council has studied the horoscopes of party leaders and draws the following conclusions: The VVD will become the largest party, Rutte will become m.p. and is doing well, Cohen disappoints and will go through a difficult period, Balkenende acquires a prominent position abroad, the coalition will consist of VVD, CDA, GroenLinks and D66. In the run-up to the House of Representatives elections, there is again a lot of discussion about possible cuts in development cooperation. What is it actually about? How much money does the Netherlands spend now? What exactly do the political parties think? The most important questions and answers at a glance. Development cooperation or development aid is intended to help poor countries become independent. National governments receive money from richer countries to improve their education, health care, economic development, agriculture and infrastructure, among other things. CDA Maintain 0.7% GNPPvdA Maintain 0.8% GNPSP Maintain 0.8% GNPVVD Halve the budget, reduce extra expenditure on sustainable energy projects - This will save 4.5 billion euros in 2015, increasing to 5.5 billion euros in 2020PVVLimit development aid to emergency aidGroenLinksAt least 0.8% Maintain GNP, climate support is on top of thatChristian Union Maintain 0.8% GNP, gradual growth to 1.0% in the short termD660.8% GNP maintainParty for the Animals Maintain 0.7% GNP + 0.25% GNP for climate measuresSGP0.8% over GNP of three years to maintainProud of the Netherlands: List Rita VerdonkSave: reduce budget by at least 2/3 of current level, budget in euros will become independent of BNP The VVD and Proud of the Netherlands and the PVV want the knife to be cut. GroenLinks, the Christian Union and the Party for the Animals want an increase in the budget. The CDA, the PvdA and D66 are in favor of maintaining existing expenditure. In 1970, the United Nations agreed to spend 0.7% of the Gross National Product (GNP) on development cooperation. This is also called the 'OECD standard'. The Netherlands spends 0.8% of its GNP annually. Expenditure in millions of euros: 197033919801,750,019902,333,020003,517,620094,728.4 About half of the Dutch contribution to development cooperation goes to Africa. In 2009 that amount was 2,364.2 million euros. The most money goes to: a top ten of the countries to which development aid goes: 1.Indonesia72.1 million euros2.Tanzania68.0 million euros3.Sudan60.0 million euros4.Ghana58.3 million euros5.Bangladesh58.2 million euros6.Suriname57 .4 million euros7.Mozambique54.6 million euros8.Mali52.0 million euros9.Zambia46.6 million euros10.Burkina Faso43.6 million euros Top ten development aid countries (2009) The theme 'Development cooperation' entails a discussion. Proponents believe that rich countries have a moral obligation to provide aid to poor countries. They believe that successes are also being achieved in the areas of education and health care. Opponents highlight the negative results, such as the persistent poverty in Africa that does not disappear despite billions in support. Development cooperation blocks independence, is a frequently heard argument. There are also doubts about the OECD standard, which dates from the last century. The amount of money that poor countries receive is based on the Gross National Product of countries, not on demand. Critics believe that such a standard can lead to spending pressure, because the money has to be spent. The major parties have reacted cautiously positively to the news that the social partners have almost agreed on raising the state pension age. The CDA finds it positive that the FNV, which campaigned against a higher state pension age, \\\"has jumped over its own shadow.\\\" The PvdA says that the near agreement looks promising. The VVD says that the agreement should yield sufficient savings. Other parties are more critical. According to the SP, elderly people end up in poverty. GroenLinks lacks a scheme for difficult professions and D66 believes that the increase in the state pension age comes into effect too late. The CDA considers it positive that the FNV has jumped over its own shadow. The party says this in an initial response to the agreement on the AOW, which employers and employees are close to. Almost all political parties emphasize that they must await the details of the agreement, but they do provide an initial response. The CDA emphasizes that the plans must also include something about the labor market for the elderly. The PvdA says it looks \\\"promising\\\". The VVD imposes the condition on the agreements between the social partners that they must generate sufficient savings for public finances. The only party that has raised the increase in the state pension age to a breaking point, the PVV, has not yet responded. GroenLinks initially reacts positively, but lacks a scheme for the difficult professions and for people who started working early. The SP sees nothing in the agreements. According to the party, the agreement is not feasible in practice and will push people into poverty. The SP also lacks a regulation for difficult professions. D66 believes that the state pension age is being raised too late in the agreement. By waiting until 2020, the costs of aging will fall unilaterally to young people, according to D66. The social partners want to increase the state pension age to 66 in 2020. After that, every five years it will be assessed whether it should increase further. According to unions and employers, it should remain possible to retire at the age of 65, but anyone who retires earlier will lose 6.5 percent of their AOW and pension. GroenLinks leader Halsema believes that parties should use the impending AOW agreement to make a proposal that may be even better. She did this in a party leader debate of the northern provinces. There does not yet appear to be a majority in favor of this plan. To combat poverty, small and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries must be given more encouragement. Princess M\\u00e1xima said this during 'Growing SMEs: it's time to invest', a conference of international business in The Hague. The event focuses on connecting investors with entrepreneurs in developing countries. In her speech, the Princess emphasized that small businesses are of utmost importance to create jobs in poorer countries. Just as in Europe, small and medium-sized enterprises must become the backbone of the economy, so that countries no longer have to be dependent on development aid. Princess M\\u00e1xima gave the speech in her position as UN advisor in the field of 'inclusive finance', for which she works worldwide to make financial services accessible to everyone. Last April she traveled in that capacity to Kenya, Rwanda and Tanzania. By Pauline Broekema There is a closed wooden coffin in the funeral home in Urk. Contents: six human skulls. After years of struggle, they are back on the former island, having been stolen for a long time. Three of the six skulls were taken in 1877 by the doctor Van Hengel. In a few days, the human remains will be buried in silence in Urk, as tradition dictates. A funeral in Urk is subdued. Although customs may have changed elsewhere, in Urk there are no white balloons and a drink in a caf\\u00e9. A funeral is usually arranged by the Christian Mutual Funeral Association Draagt \\u200b\\u200bElkanders Lasten. 89 percent of Urks are affiliated with this. An Urk funeral is sober, as has been the case for generations. The deceased usually lies in state at home. During those days of mourning, the elder comes by every evening, as is customary. To lead the family members in prayer. Urk buries its dead. Cremations are rare. The new cemetery, which was opened in 1975, is already in need of its fourth expansion. There are no more burials on the other two. Only interments are still possible. In the oldest cemetery, near the picturesque Kerkje aan de Zee, the tombstones are neatly arranged. One is buried with the feet to the east. To Jerusalem, the Mount of Olives. Graves are not cleared here. After all, whoever dies does so with firm confidence in a resurrection. Strange that a socially committed man like Dr. Van Hengel would trample on that religious belief in such a way. Johannes Frederikus van Hengel (1811-1892) fought for improvements in the living conditions of the Hilversum working class. He was a doctor there until his retirement. He described the dire living conditions of the population in 'The Medical Site Description of the Gooiland'. About alcohol abuse, infant mortality, fornication, debauchery, theft and misconduct. About drunkenness he wrote: \\\"There is certainly no greater enemy of domestic prosperity than gin; and strong drink is without a doubt also one of the first causes of poverty in the Gooiland.\\\" The socially committed Van Hengel flouted Urk traditions when he obtained some Urk skulls through deception in 1877. After his retirement in 1876 he was an observer on the island for some time, where he once again showed his social face. For example, he sends the elite of the Gooi a begging letter and asks \\\"to make a contribution to a home where old fishermen can be nursed\\\". The skulls that he stole during his time as an observer were later used in Utrecht in research to demonstrate that the Urk is directly descended from the original Dutch. It was scientific hypocrisy, which was settled with the return of the skulls. For researcher Lucia de Vries, the skulls represent the way in which Urk has been treated for decades. A patronizing attitude: about you, without you, for you. De Vries did the multimedia project Zout Zoet together with Juriaan Brouwer. They interviewed old Urk men and women for a book and a documentary. While talking, the Urks also brought up 'salty' memories. Child labor, grueling working conditions, illness. And the humiliating skull measurements, by scientists from the shore, which continued into the 1930s. When the sea became a polder, the government deemed the Urk unsuitable for that new land. And made plans to move the residents to fishing villages such as Scheveningen or Katwijk, or Brabant where they could find employment in the industry. The project broke a taboo. Suddenly it was possible to talk about that salty past in which people were ignored by science and politics. Lucia de Vries believes that it still happens to this day. The plans to build two wind farms near Urk are an example of this. Plans that are opposed by the population and local politicians, because the turbines drastically change the view of the historic village. The skulls will be buried one of these days. In the last place that was still available in the old cemetery. Next to the tower. That is where the bone cage stood where Van Hengel used a trading trick to obtain the research material. To the sustained sounds of the organ, the Urk Men's Choir sings Hallelujah and commemorates the dead of that time. Today's life is celebrated outside. The neighborhood flags. A van drives up, honking loudly. A man and a woman get out. Happiness radiates from them. A new father and mother. She carries a baby dressed in a blue romper suit on her arm. They are photographed and hugged. Neighbors unfurl a banner. Take them to their house, decorated with blue balloons and an American flag. A neighbor brings a bowl. Under aluminum foil, still warm from the fryer, lies a meal of fried fish. For the young parents. To increase the festive spirit. Pieter Jacob - nickname PJ to honor his American roots - is there. A new Urk. ZoutZoet, by Juriaan Brouwer and Lucia de Vries, published by GBU, Urk. Medical Location Description of Het Gooiland, by Dr J F van Hengel, 1875, was reprinted in 1987. By reporter Roel Pauw Imagine you are an exporter of oranges, you love Orange and you care about the children of South Africa. Then you quickly organize an action to get rid of all those warm feelings. Today during the Orange Parade in Cape Town, a pickup truck loaded with oranges will be driving along. Packaged in bags of 15 kilos that can be purchased for 20 Rand (the equivalent of 2 euros). Anyone who buys the oranges will not receive them, because they go to children in the townships of Cape Town and a few villages in the countryside of the Western Cape. Nic Jooste has contact with 51 poor communities around Cape Town through his organization Stars in their Eyes. About 180 coaches are working there to keep young people on the right path through sporting events - especially football. Because the dangers are numerous: \\\"Drugs, alcohol, AIDS, teenage pregnancies, and often malnutrition. Many people live below the breadline,\\\" says Jooste. The word 'poverty line' that we might use is not even adequate, because it is all a degree worse in South Africa. The Dutch consulate and the organizing committee of the World Cup in Cape Town have also committed to the campaign. And a Kaapse Klopse provides the music. This is a hoempapa band that, as Consul General David de Waal explains, has a long tradition: \\\"In the past, the slaves were all free on January 2. Then they really went wild. In this part of South Africa you have a lot of those Klopses and they still take to the streets on January 2 to make a lot of noise.\\\" For this occasion a band from the poor Delft district will play. They play Hup Holland Hup and other classics from the Dutch football repertoire. Such an orange is of course nice, but also nothing more than a symbolic gesture. \\\"But,\\\" says Jooste, \\\"I have seen in recent weeks that there is a lot of willingness to do something good for this country. And if the poorest people now see that they are at least being thought about, then they will give it for this moment the feeling that they matter.\\\" Prominent Dutch people call on the informants to advocate an international policy aimed at sustainability and poverty reduction. The Netherlands must have the ambition to be a leader in tackling the challenges of the 21st century, says a letter to Uri Rosenthal and Jacques Wallage. The letter writers mention the financial crisis and the food, energy and climate crisis. They argue that our prosperity and security depend on stability and progress in developing countries. The letter was signed by prominent figures from various political directions. At the bottom of the letter are the names of former Rabot CEO Herman Wijffels (CDA), former Defense Minister Joris Voorhoeve (VVD and D66), Erica Terpstra (VVD), Lodewijk de Waal (PvdA), Paul Rosenm\\u00f6ller (GroenLinks) and Jeltje van Nieuwenhoven (PvdA). For the time being, the US government is not allowed to spend money on further research into stem cell technology. Stem cell researcher Derk ten Berge leads a research team at Erasmus MC and answers five questions about stem cell therapy. What is an embryonic stem cell? Human embryonic stem cells can produce all cell types and tissues in our body. These stem cells are isolated from embryos that have not yet been implanted in the uterus. These embryos come from IVF clinics, where the woman's eggs are fertilized with the man's sperm cells in a test tube. Some of the resulting embryos are placed back in the uterus, the rest are frozen. Embryos used for stem cell technology are surplus and lie unused in the freezer. Parents must give permission for their embryos to be used for research. Is an embryo a human? The embryos used for embryonic stem cells are five to six days old. They are balls of about 50 cells without a head, trunk, limbs or sex. A commonly used definition of 'human' is an individual who can exist apart from the mother. Babies can do this when they are born at nine months. Premature babies can also exist outside the mother's body, but fetuses younger than six months cannot do so independently. From that stage onwards, the same protection applies as for every human being. Critics of stem cell therapy believe that a five-day embryo is already a human being and should not simply be used for stem cells. That is why the production of embryonic stem cells is subject to strict rules. What does stem cell therapy entail? First, we are trying to create tissue that we can use for transplant therapies. That is not yet possible, but a lot of research is being done. In the case of Parkinson's, for example, nerve cells die. We hope that if you replace those cells, the symptoms can go away. And if you grow blood cells, you no longer need a blood donor and you have no risks of infectious diseases or a shortage of the correct blood group. The development of stem cells in tissue is difficult to control, we don't yet know how to do that. Second, we can study the cause of hereditary diseases, such as Parkinson's and Down's syndrome, because we can track the development of cell types in stem cell cultures. Then you get an idea of \\u200b\\u200bthe mechanism: where does it go wrong and can we intervene? Are there new medications that address the cause of the disease? How advanced is the technology? In 1998, human embryonic stem cells were isolated for the first time. Since then, we have made great progress in creating these stem cells and directing their development. It is hoped that the first tentative tests with patients will be possible within a few years, especially for the treatment of spinal cord injury, age-related blindness and diabetes. A major breakthrough is that we can now convert adult cells into cells that are very similar to embryonic stem cells. These adult cells have many of the same properties as the embryonic ones. We hope that these cells will make the use of embryonic stem cells unnecessary. Much research into real embryonic stem cells is still needed to achieve this. There is a problem, because stem cells can also make tumors. This happens when a few cells that have not developed in the right tissue, but have remained an embryonic stem cell. The research therefore focuses strongly on preventing tumor-forming cells. Despite all the problems, so much research is being done that progress is happening quickly, and we are therefore cautiously optimistic. What is the status of stem cell therapy in the Netherlands? Research into stem cell technology is receiving enormous attention. The Netherlands plays an important role in research internationally. About ten laboratories conduct research with human embryonic stem cells. A lot of research is also being done into stem cells that are more specialized and do not come from embryos but from patients themselves or from other people. These are not as versatile as embryonic stem cells, but there are no ethical concerns and fewer risks involved. An example is stem cells derived from umbilical cord blood that can be collected after the birth of a baby. These can be used for transplantation in leukemia patients. The umbilical cord blood contains blood stem cells that help the patient heal. For the first time, swamp fever has appeared at a Dutch horse company. The virus was found in Great Britain in a horse that came from Ede. The infectious disease can lead to anemia, weight loss and fever. In severe cases, the animal can die. Equine disease is not dangerous to humans. The main spreaders of swamp fever are horseflies and stable flies. Infected horses remain carriers of the virus for life. The company in Ede is no longer allowed to transport animals until it has been established that the eighteen horses in the stables are not infected. The horse with swamp fever has been put down. Many Dutch people who live below the poverty line have difficulty getting out of this situation. This is what the Social and Cultural Planning Office (SCP) says. Six in ten of low-income households are in better financial shape three years later. The other forty percent were still below the poverty line after three years. Native Dutch people are five times more likely to escape poverty permanently than non-Western migrants. To determine whether someone lives in poverty, the Planning Bureau based its assessment on the so-called low-income limit. In 2007, during the research, this was 900 euros per month for a single person. For the report, SCP conducted a random sample among hundreds of thousands of households that lived below this limit in 2004. Finding work or better paid work is usually very important for whether someone is poor. Native Dutch people generally manage to find work much faster than migrants. According to the CPB, this is why it is more difficult to leave poverty behind in the latter group. Nearly half of the poor had not looked for work in the 3.5 years prior to the survey. Of these, half say that their poor health is the reason for not applying for a job. Members of the States General, If we want to be able to decisively shape economic recovery, stable governance is desirable. Since the House of Representatives elections of June 9, intensive work has been going on to create a new cabinet. During the current cabinet formation, the current cabinet is exercising restraint in making policy proposals for the coming year. The consequences of the financial and economic crisis will continue to be felt for a long time and worldwide. A drastic package of changes is now necessary to improve our country's position in the long term. Measures for the years after 2011 will obviously have to be prepared by a new cabinet. A prerequisite for sustainable development and prosperity is a stable budget policy. Additional proposals to reduce the annual budget deficit are inevitable. The government has already deployed the necessary resources to stimulate the economy. This policy can no longer be continued unchanged. As a result of declining tax revenues and stimulus measures, the government deficit has risen sharply. National debt and deficit are rising to a level that is unsustainable in the long term. Structural financial measures will have to be taken now. To reduce the high government deficits, the government is putting forward proposals that will improve the financial position of the national budget in the long term. The conditions of the European Stability and Growth Pact, to which our country is bound, are also met. The government's choices are mainly motivated by the desire and need to reduce the level of expenditure. Although unemployment in the Netherlands has risen less than in the countries around us, the government remains committed to reducing it. In these difficult times, it is important to provide support to all residents of our country, with a policy aimed at maintaining employment and strengthening the economy. In the long term, the labor market will be characterized by a declining labor supply as a result of the aging population. It remains necessary to take measures that increase labor participation, improve the employability of employees and promote labor mobility. The Netherlands' prosperity is largely dependent on the supply of goods and services abroad. Strongly increasing competition on the export markets must be taken into account in the coming years. Due to our relatively high labor cost level, our country will have to continue to make efforts to withstand competition by providing innovative, high-quality products and services. Responsible wage development is an important condition. A strong and stable financial sector is of particular importance for our society and our internationally operating business community. It is therefore essential that social trust in the sector is restored. Steps have already been taken internationally to tighten supervision. Proposals are being prepared for better cooperation between supervisors and strengthening the reserve position of institutions. The Dutch financial sector itself has shown responsibility by drawing up the Banking Code. Legal anchoring of this forms a basis for restoring the relationship of trust with society with the help of stricter capital requirements and mandatory remuneration principles. A separate structure will be set up for the management of financial institutions taken over by the State. The Dutch pension system is robust compared to the systems of other countries. But measures are necessary because rising life expectancy is putting pressure on pension benefits. In order to ensure a good pension for future generations after a working life, an increase in the retirement age is logical. Employers and employees have already indicated that they want to work together on this. In addition, the economic crisis has serious consequences for the value of our pension assets. The government is committed to ensuring that existing regulations are complied with in order to restore confidence in the long term. It is not purely financial and economic developments that are decisive for society. Social developments also have an impact on the quality of our society. Social cohesion was often taken for granted in Dutch society. However, in recent years we have become aware that this is not the case. In the past, continuous efforts were necessary to keep contradictions and differences of opinion in society manageable. This necessity has not diminished in our time. Providing a counterbalance is not only a task for the government, but also for citizens and the many social organizations in our country. A harmonious society is built on respect, tolerance and civility. That requires give and take, tolerance but also adjustment. This is the responsibility of all of us. Our increasing life expectancy is a great asset. At the same time, it presents society with new challenges. For example, an adequate education system, high-quality healthcare, a liveable living environment and a safe society are facilities that require the necessary financial efforts. Quality and accessibility are central. Improving quality in education has always been a priority of government policy. Many steps still need to be taken on this path. In addition to acquiring knowledge, connecting with the business community and the labor market is also important. In its final report, the Innovation Platform has made proposals to help the Netherlands rise from tenth place to the top five on the list of knowledge economies. The ambition to make our country a truly knowledge country requires good education and research. In the budget submitted today, the government spares education. In addition, she appeals to the business community for a higher contribution to development and research. Healthcare in our country is of good quality. The accessibility of this is very wide for all Dutch people. On the other hand, costs have increased sharply in recent years, partly due to the growing demand for care. This is caused by increasing technological improvements and increasing life expectancy. Measures to control costs will be taken in order to further increase efficiency in hospital care. To restore accessibility and confidence in the housing market, investments and flow must be promoted. The government has taken measures to stimulate housing construction. This is necessary, because not only the population continues to grow, but also the number of households. There is still a great need for good and affordable housing, especially in the Randstad. In addition, attention continues to be paid to the specific problems of shrinking areas. The government will improve mobility by an accelerated approach to infrastructure bottlenecks. A targeted working method will have to guarantee that the Netherlands is well protected against water. In addition, sufficient fresh water must be available, even in periods of drought. For years, safety policy has been aimed at tackling nuisance and crime, but also at structurally improving the quality of the living environment in the neighborhoods. The district-oriented approach remains a good instrument for working on this together with municipalities, citizens and housing associations. The youth policy is based on the experience that prevention pays off. All children must be given equal opportunities to develop. School dropout must be combated effectively. Actively securing and protecting society and citizens against intimidation, discrimination and violence remains a high priority of the government. The Netherlands is the second largest exporter of agricultural and horticultural products. The innovative and sustainable character of our agricultural sector is highly regarded worldwide. Our country can make an important contribution to global food security by continuing to work on improving current technologies. The government creates preconditions for sustainable production methods. The financial and economic crisis has once again made it clear how intertwined the Netherlands is with the world around us. It inspires confidence that Europe can operate decisively in difficult times. Europe not only shows its added value in the financial and economic field. Important steps are also being taken in the field of sustainability. For example, in the coming year, a decision will be made in Europe on tightening emission standards for car traffic. In contacts with our partners and international organizations, the fight against poverty in the world, the sustainability of our planet, the strengthening of human rights and international peace and security have a central place. The efforts of the Netherlands during the past G20 and European summits can be seen in this light. Stability, peace and good governance are served by cooperation within international organizations such as the European Union, NATO and the United Nations. A well-equipped security and defense organization contributes to this. The first task of our armed forces is to ensure the security of our own and allied territory. In addition, the Netherlands has also accepted the assignment to contribute to international peace missions and crisis management operations. We owe a great thank you to the men and women who have deployed in Afghanistan over the past eight years, especially in Uruzgan province, to help the population build a better future. We would also like to extend our gratitude to those who still bear responsibility for the safe return of the last units and equipment. Deepest condolences go out to those who have been injured in the performance of their duties. We will continue to have deep respect for those who gave their lives in fulfilling their mission. They - and their relatives - remain in our thoughts. We can all be proud of what has been accomplished in Afghanistan under very difficult circumstances. Preparations have been made to implement the political innovations within the kingdom. The Netherlands Antilles will cease to exist as a country within the kingdom. Cura\\u00e7ao and Sint Maarten will each receive country status. The island territories of Bonaire, St. Eustatius and Saba will become part of the Dutch government as a public body. Cura\\u00e7ao and Sint Maarten can continue to count on support from the government in the field of law enforcement and good governance. Members of the States General, In anticipation of the appointment of a new cabinet, you are preparing for proposals that will be submitted to you in many policy areas. How this will be handled will have to be decided in consultation with you. It is certain that a lot of attention and effort will be required of you in the important decisions that are needed to tackle our economic and social problems. You may feel supported in this by the realization that many wish you wisdom and pray with me for strength and God's blessing for you. Is he behind the language joke in the Speech from the Throne? \\\"That is the secret of Noordeinde,\\\" chuckles outgoing Minister Donner of Social Affairs, who answered questions from listeners in the Radio 1 Journaal this morning. These questions vary considerably: they are about the pun and the kiss on the hand, but also about the security of pensions and the labor participation of women. A large number of questions were received about the announced cuts in childcare. Listeners want to know why these cuts are necessary there. \\\"We have tried to make cuts as balanced as possible,\\\" says Donner. \\\"That also includes childcare.\\\" Donner says that childcare costs have grown enormously, from 700 million euros in 2005 to 3 billion euros last year. \\\"Yet it remains the case that even with a low income, an extra day of work ultimately yields more than the costs of childcare,\\\" he says, adding that it cannot be the case that benefits are cut while childcare remains untouched. Donner opposes the image that the current government parties CDA and Christian Union want to discourage women from continuing to work and prefer to see them take care of the family. \\\"That would be strange, because under a CDA prime minister the costs of childcare have risen so enormously,\\\" says the minister. Many questions were also received about government finances, health care costs, raising the state pension age and the Dutch pension system, which has regularly received negative news in recent weeks due to declining coverage ratios of pension funds. \\\"The House is rightly concerned about this,\\\" says Donner, but immediately adds that, in his opinion, the House of Representatives is not tackling the problem sufficiently. \\u201cA major part of the problem is that the retirement age needs to be adjusted to the ever-increasing life expectancy,\\u201d he says. \\\"The way for this must be cleared by also adjusting the state pension age. I have called on the House to do this, there is a large majority in favor of it, so there is no reason to pass it up.\\\" The minister says that the House should not complain about the situation at the pension funds if it fails to raise the state pension age. \\u201cWhat one can do, one doesn't do,\\u201d he says. Donner does not want to comment on the crisis within the CDA. \\u201cI've decided not to respond to each other all the time,\\u201d says Donner. He also does not want to say anything about how he looks back on the past few weeks and the formation process. \\\"I usually don't talk about my feelings,\\\" the minister jokes. A listener is curious about who Donner kissed on the hand on Budget Day. \\\"Well, well...\\\" is the initial answer. Only after repeated insistence (\\\"Get the hell out of here!\\\") does he say: \\\"We had strict instructions that we were only allowed to shake hands with the chairman of the House of Representatives. And I know the clerk of the House very well...\\\". On the right side of this page you will find the conversation with Minister Piet Hein Donner. D66 and GroenLinks believe that the government is \\\"destroying\\\" work with its cuts. Pechtold (D66) pointed out that there is no reform in the field of unemployment benefits and dismissal law, and that the AOW issue is being \\\"parked\\\". SP leader Roemer says that the cabinet is driving people straight into poverty. Roemer's comment referred, among other things, to the cuts in benefits for people who became disabled at a young age. Development organization SNV reduces the salary of director Dirk Elsen. The organization was in danger of losing the subsidy because Elsen earns too much. To be eligible for a subsidy, a director of a development organization may not earn more than a director-general at a ministry. That is just over 124,000 euros per year. For the same reason, the Royal Tropical Institute also reduced the salary of its director earlier this week. State Secretary Knapen of Development Cooperation is happy with the salary reduction of the SNV director. According to Knapen, times have changed and such a high salary is no longer possible. \\\"It is annoying when the salary of a development cooperation director is discussed in detail. It is distracting. It seems as if people are enriching themselves there,\\\" says Knapen. \\\"That is not good for the organization and for development cooperation.\\\" SNV is one of the largest development organizations in the Netherlands. The organization provides advice to local organizations and governments to reduce poverty. By editor Aalt van het Veen The clothing banks in the Netherlands notice that a growing group of Dutch people can no longer make ends meet. Due to the crisis, demand is increasing enormously, clothing items are almost impossible to obtain. Not only unemployed people have to make their way to the clothing bank, more and more workers with a low income are turning to it. \\\"It's bad enough that people have to come here for clothes. We think it's important that our customers leave with their heads held high.\\\" Ron Verhees founded a clothing bank in Maasbracht in Limburg five years ago. People who are in financial trouble can get free clothing. Verhees sets strict requirements for the clothing offered and the way in which the items are displayed. \\\"Underwear is always new, outerwear must fit in with the fashion image and hang nicely on racks. The idea behind it is that our customers' self-esteem grows and they see our help as an incentive to get back to work.\\\" However, only people with a referral from, for example, their GP, home care or the social affairs department of a municipality are eligible for free clothing. Working at the clothing bank offers volunteers the opportunity to gain work experience. Verhees: \\\"People work here who, for example, have been unemployed for a long time and want to get back to work, and people with a psychiatric background who come to gain work experience. We can guide young people, because we are recognized as a work-study company.\\\" The Limburg way of working will be adopted by all clothing banks in the Netherlands next year.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
